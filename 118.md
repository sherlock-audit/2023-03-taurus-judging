# TauMath#_computeCR breaks vault compatibility with tokens that don't have 18 decimals

## Summary

The variables MIN_COL_RATIO and MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO in BaseVault are constants and are represented to 18 decimals. The issues is that TauMath#_computeCR always returns the ratio in the decimals of the collateral. The result is that BaseVault is incompatible with tokens that don't have 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

[TauMath.sol#L17-L21](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Libs/TauMath.sol#L17-L21)

        if (_debt > 0) {
            uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals);

            return newCollRatio;
        }

When calculating newCollRatio the end results ends up being the same number of decimals as _coll. This means that 6 dp collateral will return a newCollRatio to 6 decimals. 

[BaseVault.sol#L123-L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L123-L127)

    function getAccountHealth(address _account) public view returns (bool) {
        uint256 ratio = _getCollRatio(_account);

        return (ratio > MIN_COL_RATIO);
    }

The ratio returned by this is directly compared against MIN_COL_RATIO (and MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO  elsewhere) which are both constants and specified to 18 decimals. Since they are constants and can't be lowered the vault is incompatible with any token that isn't 18 dp.

## Impact

Vault is incompatible with non-18 dp tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ratio constants should be scaled the same number of decimals as the collateral.
