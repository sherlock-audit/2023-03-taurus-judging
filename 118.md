# TauMath#_computeCR breaks vault compatibility with tokens that don't have 18 decimals

## Summary

MIN_COL_RATIO and MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO are constants and are represented to 18 decimals. The issues is that TauMath#_computeCR always returns the ratio in the decimals of the collateral. The result is that BaseVault is incompatible with tokens that don't have 18 decimals.
