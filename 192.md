# computing CR only works for collateral with 18 decimals value

## Summary

When calculating collateral ratio with `TauMath#_computeCR` method if we use a collateral with decimals larger then 18 we can get an arithmetic overflow.

Collateral ratio in the protocol is represented as an 18 decimal precision value but the calculation will be wrong if asset is not 18 decimal.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating collateral ratio for a asset that has 30 decimals precession (for example `GLPPriceOracle` reports price as 30 decimal precision value) we get an arithmetic overflow in this line:

## Impact

The current collateral ratio calculation is limited to asset that only supports 18 decimals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calculating the collateral ratio is recommend to scale up/down the collateral value and collateral price to 18 decimals before the calculation.
