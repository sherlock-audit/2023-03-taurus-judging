# The function `burnFrom` of token TAU is incorrect, leading to the vault can mint only a part of its limit

## Summary
Function `burnFrom` of token TAU is  incorrect, that it calls `_decreaseCurrentMinted` with address account. It will not pass the check of `currentMinted` in  functio `_decreaseCurrentMinted`, and `currentMinted` of vault will not be decreased. Then the vault can mint only a part of its limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In contract TAU.sol:
```solidity=
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual override {
    super.burnFrom(account, amount);
    _decreaseCurrentMinted(account, amount);
}

function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
    // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
    uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
    if (accountMinted >= amount) {
        currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
    }
}
```
Only the vaults can mint TAU tokens, it means other addresses always have `currentMinted` = 0. Then `currentMinted[msg.sender]` (currentMinted of the vault) will not be decreased.
Function `burnFrom` is always called when the vault modify or liquidate positions of users. The more actions, the less TAU tokens can be minted by this vault.

## Impact
Only a part of the vault's mint limit that TAU tokens can be minted.

## Recommendation
Fix function `burnFrom` as the following:
```solidity=
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual override {
    super.burnFrom(account, amount);
    _decreaseCurrentMinted(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
