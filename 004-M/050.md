# Accounting error for TAU currentMinted

## Summary

Due to accounting error in minted / burned TAU for vaults, it could be that a vault has more total debt than `TAU.currentMinted[vault]`, which will escalate into more accounting errors over time and may lead to reaching the mint limit set by `TAU.sol` prematurely.

## Vulnerability Detail

The TAU token contract has limits set for each vault for the maximum amount of TAU that can be minted by the vault. This limit is set by the governance address.

When a vault mints token, the tracked amount of TAU minted by the vault is increased and the mint reverts if the amount exceeds the vault's limit. When a vault burns token using `burn()`, `currentMinted[vault]` decreases by the burned amount if it is not bigger than the current minted amount for the vault.

The `SwapHandler.swapForTau()` function swaps yield received for TAU, burns the TAU (so decreases currentMinted[vault]) and rewards users by repaying their debt for a portion of the burned TAU based on the `_rewardProportion` value. Since only a portion of the burnt TAU repays debt, the total outstanding debt of the vault is higher than `currentMinted[vault]`.

If users repay their debts, we will reach a moment where `currentMinted[vault]` is lower than the amount of debt repaid by a user. At this point the `currentMinted[vault]` will not be lowered by the amount of TAU burnt in the debt repayment.

As result the `currentMinted[vault]` value can be higher than the value the vault actually minted.

This issue can be repeated multiple times to further decorrelate the `currentMinted[vault]` value from its correct value. The issue amplifies itself as the more wrong this value is, the more likely it is that user repaid debt exceeds `currentMinted[vault]`.

## Impact

Accounting of `currentMinted[vault]` is not properly done and may bring vaults to reach the mint limit faster than planned, preventing them from minting TAU further (opening user positions with debt).

## Code Snippet

TAU mint function increase current minted and reverts above limit:

TAU burn function decreases current minted:

swapForTau burns an amount of TAU but only repays part of it towards user debt:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow `currentMinted` to go negative e.g. by using an additional storage value `currentMintedDebt` that will be increased when an amount of token is burnt that is above `currentMinted[vault]` and used to lower `currentMinted[vault]` when minting new tokens.
