# LiquidationBot: liquidate function should exit gracefully on error but it reverts which can lead to problems with liquidation

## Summary
The `LiquidationBot.liquidate` function is supposed to attempt liquidation and if an error occurs it should exit gracefully:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/LiquidationBot/LiquidationBot.sol#L100-L105

However the way the code tries to catch Errors is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail
`catch Error(string memory)` only catches Errors if a string argument is provided.

By looking into the liquidation code you can see that there are many examples for how the code can revert that do not provide a string:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L347

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L368

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L434

In all of these cases the current implementation does not work.
It must work for all kinds of arguments not just "String".

## Impact
This can lead to unexpected reverts. Especially if the keeper is a contract that integrates with the `LiquidationBot` contract then this can cause the keeper to stop working.
