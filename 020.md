# No way for liquidation bot to remove approval for tokens

## Summary
Liquidation bot can only approve vault address the maximum number of tokens of any kind, but cannot revoke approval

## Vulnerability Detail
Token approval is used to allow vault to take tokens from the bot to pay the liquidation fee when a position is being liquidated. Because approval cannot be revoked, if the vault address becomes exploited, and we want to change to a new vault, we are not able to do so since we are giving maximum token approval to the old vault.

## Impact
Maximum approval that cannot be revoked being given to a vault can be dangerous as it allows assets from the bot to be taken at will by the approved.
