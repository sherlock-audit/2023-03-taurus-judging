# User cannot exit paused vaults

## Summary

User cannot exit paused vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

Documentation states: 
```md
Pause vaults. Users can exit paused vaults, but otherwise no significant action should be possible on them.
```

but user cannot withdraw their collateral when vault is paused.

```solidity
    it("cannot modify position if the vault is paused", async () => {
      await expect(gmxVault.modifyPosition(PRECISION, PRECISION, true, false)).to.be.revertedWith("Pausable: paused");
    });
```

Since the protocol has one function, `modifyPosition()`, to handle both debt loans and repayment, and collateral deposits and withdrawal, the modifier `whenNotPaused` will impact all actions related to collateral and debt changes.

```solidity
    function modifyPosition(
        uint256 _collateralDelta,
        uint256 _debtDelta,
        bool _increaseCollateral,
        bool _increaseDebt
    ) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
        _modifyPosition(msg.sender, _collateralDelta, _debtDelta, _increaseCollateral, _increaseDebt);
    }
```

## Impact

User cannot exit paused vaults.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider splitting the debt and collateral change functions so that `whenNotPaused` can only affect debt repayment and loan.
