# Logic Error in _decreaseCurrentMinted

## Summary
Logic Error in _decreaseCurrentMinted
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `TAU.sol` contract,` _decreaseCurrentMinted` is used to reduce a user's currentMinted value.

```solidity
function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
    // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
    uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
    if (accountMinted >= amount) {
        currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;//@audit
    }
}
```
In the last line, the code updates the value of `currentMinted[msg.sender]`, which is incorrect. It should update the value of `currentMinted[account]`.

For example, there are two users A and B. When A calls `burn(1)`, the value of `currentMinted[A]` will be updated. However, when A calls `burnFrom(B,1)`, the value of `currentMinted[A]` will still be updated, but it should update the value of `currentMinted[B]`.
