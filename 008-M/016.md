# Bot liquidations always ignore slippage

## Summary
Liquidations by Bot ignores slippage (hard-coded to `0`). This means that it is open to front-running attacks that manipulate the collateral price.
## Vulnerability Detail

In `liquidate()` of LiquidationBot.sol, vault.liquidate is called with 0 `_minExchangeRate`:

Since the amount of collateral to liquidate relies on price, an attacker 1) can watch for `LiquidationBot.liquidate()` calls, and 2) manipulate the GLP price and cause liquidations to receive less collateral than expected.

## Impact
Liquidation Bot will "overpay" for liquidations. In otherwords, less collateral per Tau will be received.

## Recommendation
- Consider calculating some acceptable amount of slippage to reduce price manipulation attacks.
