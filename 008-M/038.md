# Liquidator burns more TAU than repaid debt

## Summary

When a liquidator calls `liquidate()` and the whole collateral for the user is to be liquidated, the user may burn more TAU than he receives collateral (proportional to price) due to truncated `collateralToLiquidate` value.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_calcLiquidation`, if the calculated collateral to liquidate is greater than the collateral available in the user position, the value of collateral liquidated is truncated:

This truncated returned value is later used to lower the collateral of the user:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L359-L376

However, as we can see, there is no adjustments made to the `_debtAmount` withdrawn from the user's position and burned from the liquidator.

If the collateral ratio of the position is smaller than 1, the total collateral of a user should be liquidatable for a lower price than its debt. I.e. after optimal liquidation, there should be some debt and no collateral remaining. If `liquidate` is called with a `debtAmount` covering the total user debt, the liquidator will pay the full `debtAmount` and receive onlyÂ `collateral * price < debtAmount` worth of collateral back.

## Impact

This impact is partially mitigated by `_minExchangeRate` parameter of the `liquidate()` function that reverts liquidation when received collateral is below expected value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L367-L369

However, this parameter may not be used by external liquidators and is unused by the liquidation bot:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/LiquidationBot/LiquidationBot.sol#L100

External users should not want to trigger liquidation if collateral ratio is greater than 1. If they trigger liquidation when the collateral ratio is lower than 1 and do not use the `_minExchangeRate` parameter, liquidator will pay out some part of debt without receiving collateral.

Liquidation bot will likely burn more TAU than needed.

## Recommendation

Truncate the amount of debt paid out to match the value of collateral received.
