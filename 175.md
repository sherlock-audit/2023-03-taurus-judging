# Bad debt stucks forever

## Summary
When a black swan occasion happens liquidators can repay only the profitable part (up to max collateral) and leave the excess debt behind.
## Vulnerability Detail
As in the Sherlock docs, Taurus teams identifies this as a not valid finding. However, if a user has 100 collateral and 120 debt at some point and if a liquidator only liquidates the 100 collateral that would end up the users total position as: 0 collateral and 20 debt. There are no ways to repay the excess debt for this user because of how liquidate function works. This debt will be stuck in the protocol forever. 

Here the collateralToLiquidate will always be 0 since there are no collateral backing for user. However, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L420 this line will not be 0, because it is not calculating the surcharge with the actual collateral but with the collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount. So the return variables will be : (0, some amount) 

and this line will always revert https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L366
since the collateralToLiquidate is 0 and surcharge is non-zero.

Example:
User has 0 collateral and 20 debt
liquidator tries to liquidate the remaining 20, so collateralToLiquidate = 0, liquidationSurcharge = 20*0.02 = 0.4 which 0-0.4 == revert

So in conclusion, even someone taking the loss can not repay the debt of a user that does not have enough collateral. It will be forever stuck.
