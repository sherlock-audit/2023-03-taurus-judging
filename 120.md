# _decreaseCurrentMinted() does not revise currentMinted() correctly, as a result, a wrong mint limit might be enforced on a vault.

## Summary
``_decreaseCurrentMinted()`` does not revise ``currentMinted`` correctly, as a result, a wrong mint limit might be enforced on a vault. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``_decreaseCurrentMinted()`` function was used in ``burn()`` and ``burnFrom()`` functions to decrease the  accounting of ``currentMinted`` .

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L76-L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L76-L83)

However, the modification only occurs when ``accountMinted >= amount``, which means, if ``accountMinted <  amount``, ``accountMinted`` will not be modified while TAU tokens are burned. This leads to inconsistency. As a result, when ``mint()`` is called to mint more TAU tokens by the vault, it might be reverted due to a false violation of mint limit. 

Here is an example: 
1) Suppose Vault A has a mint limit of 2000, and Vault A has already minted 2000 TAU. 

2) Another user sent 100 TAU to Vault A.

3) Vault A calls ``burn()`` to burn 2100, however, since ``2100 > accountMinted[VaultA]``, ``accountMinted[VaultA]`` will not be modified, although in this case,  ``accountMinted[VaultA]`` should be set to zero.

4) Now if Vault A calls "mint()`` to mint 2000 TAU, it will be rejected due to  ``accountMinted[VaultA] = 2000``. It will falsely report that Vault A already reaches the limit even though it has just burned 2100 TAU.

## Impact
The accounting of ``accountMinted`` is incorrect for function  ``_decreaseCurrentMinted()``. As a result, a vault might not be able to mint more TAU even though it has not reached the limit - the system will falsely report that it has already reached the mint limit

Manual Review


## Recommendation
We will set ``accountMinted``  = 0 when ``accountMinted >= amount``.

```diff
function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
+     else{
+          currentMinted[msg.sender] = 0;
+     }
    }
```
