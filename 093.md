# getUsersDetailsInRange() Function Fails to Include End Index User, Potentially Impacting Liquidation and System Stability

## Summary

The `getUsersDetailsInRange()` function in the `BaseVault.sol` contract does not include both the start and end indexes, always returning an array with the last user details being empty.

## Vulnerability Detail

The getUsersDetailsInRange() function is intended to return an array of user details between a given start and end index, both inclusive. However, the current implementation of the function always returns an array with the last user's details being empty. This is because the for loop used to populate the `users` array checks for `_start < _end`, which excludes the last index.

## Impact
**High**.

This vulnerability can cause significant issues during liquidation. For example, if the last user in the index has a large debt and low collateralization ratio, this function will return the last user's debt and collateral as 0. This can cause the liquidator to fail to liquidate the user's assets, leaving the system with bad debt.


## Code Snippet

[link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L160-L168)

In the following code snippet, a memory array `users`  is created to include both the start and end indexes. For example, if the start index is 1 and the end index is 5, the array will return (5-1+1) or 5 items. However, the `for` loop checks for `_start < _end`, which excludes the **end** index. Therefore, the array returned by the function will always have the last item as empty.

```solidity
    /** @dev Get the user details in the range given start and end index.
     * note the start and end index are inclusive
     */
    function getUsersDetailsInRange(uint256 _start, uint256 _end) public view returns (UserDetails[] memory users) {
        if (_end > getUsersCount() || _start > _end) revert indexOutOfBound();

        users = new UserDetails[](_end - _start + 1);

        for (uint i = _start; i < _end; ++i) {
            users[i - _start] = userDetails[userAddresses[i]];
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend updating the for loop condition to check `_start <= _end` instead.

```diff
-        for (uint256 i = _start; i < _end; ++i) {
+        for (uint256 i = _start; i <= _end; ++i) {
```
