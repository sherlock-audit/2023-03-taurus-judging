# Vault doesnt account for fee on transfer tokens, which can affect the accounting logic

## Summary

If the collateral token has a fee on transfer, the vault will receive less tokens than it expects to.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user transfers collateral via `modifyPosition`, collateral is added to the user's balance via the following code snippet:
`userDetails[_account].collateral += _collateralDelta; IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _collateralDelta);`

However, if the collateral token has a fee on transfer, the protocol will receive `_collateralDelta - fee` of the collateral transferred, but the user's collateral balance will not reflect this deduction.


Consider the following scenario:
1. Token X is fee-on-transfer and it took 10% for each transfer. Alice deposits 1000 token X and Bob deposits 2000 token X
2. However, due to the fee, the protocol received 2700 tokens instead of 3000, because of the fee.
3. Bob decides to withdraw 2000 tokens from the protocol, which leaves the protocol with only 700 tokens.
4. Following Bob's withdrawal, the remaining balance of Token X in the Vault is 700, rendering it impossible for Alice to withdraw her funds.

There are several places that use the accounting logic which would lead to errors. e.g.
1. Even though Alice should be liquidatable now - she cannot be liquidated, because the protocol doesn't account for the difference.
2. The updateReward function will be using the user collateral without fee to calculate rewards

```solidity
         uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION;
```

Here's a POC in Foundry proving the point.

        vault.modifyPosition(1.21 ether, 1, true, true);

        // Attacker collateral is 1.11 ether
        
        // Account is liquidatable, but function renders it as healthy.

    }

}
```

## Impact

Due to the fact that the protocol doesn't support fee on transfer tokens, a substantial part of its accounting logic will behave unexpectedly.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation

The recommendation to address this vulnerability is to add the code snippet mentioned above to ensure that the protocol accounts for any fees on transfer tokens correctly.

```diff
                userDetails[_account].collateral += _collateralDelta;
+                uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(address.this);
                IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _collateralDelta);
+                uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(address.this);

+                require(balanceAfter - _collateralDelta == balanceBefore);
```
