# [Medium] If the `CollRatio` is very low and liquidation surcharge is still charged, the overall `CollRatio` of the vault may become lower, increasing the risk

## Summary

```solidity
    // BaseVault.sol line 398
    function _calcLiquidation(
        uint256 _accountCollateral,
        uint256 _accountDebt,
        uint256 _debtToLiquidate
    ) internal view returns (uint256 collateralToLiquidate, uint256 liquidationSurcharge) {
        (uint256 price, uint8 decimals) = _getCollPrice();
        uint256 _collRatio = TauMath._computeCR(_accountCollateral, _accountDebt, price, decimals);

        //// totalLiquidationDiscount max is 120%
        uint256 totalLiquidationDiscount = _calcLiquidationDiscount(_collRatio);

        uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * (10 ** decimals)) / price;
        collateralToLiquidate = (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * totalLiquidationDiscount) / Constants.PRECISION;
        if (collateralToLiquidate > _accountCollateral) {
            collateralToLiquidate = _accountCollateral;
        }

        // Revert if requested liquidation amount is greater than allowed
        if (
            _debtToLiquidate >
            _getMaxLiquidation(_accountCollateral, _accountDebt, price, decimals, totalLiquidationDiscount)
        ) revert wrongLiquidationAmount();

        return (
            collateralToLiquidate, //// LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE = 2%
            (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE) / Constants.PRECISION
        );
    }
```

If the user is triggered to liquidate, 2% of the collater will be transferred to Taurus. If the collater depreciates too quickly, for example, `CollRatio` reaches 100%, and if another 2% is transferred to Taurus, then the actual `CollRatio` of liquidation is 98% (< 100%). Once the `CollRatio` is lower than 100%, the liquidator will be more reluctant to liquidate the position, because it is equivalent to buying a collater at a higher market price. This will lead to a vicious circle.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

This will increase the risk of Taurus and may vicious circle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is suggested that if `CollRatio` is too low, liquidation surcharge will no longer be charged.
