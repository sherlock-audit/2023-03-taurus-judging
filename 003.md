# User can mint unlimited TAU tokens.

## Summary

```mint``` function limits ```msg.sender``` to mint max given amount of tokens, but in fact malicious user can call this function with different account every time passing as ```recipient``` his main address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose ```Bob``` has called ```mint``` function enough times that he had reached the limit.
Then he will create another address and will call again ```mint``` function passsing he's previous address which is reached the limit.
He can repeat this as many times as he wants.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L46

```solidity
    function mint(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        // Check whether mint amount exceeds mintLimit for msg.sender
        uint256 newMinted = currentMinted[msg.sender] + amount;
        if (newMinted > mintLimit[msg.sender]) {
            revert mintLimitExceeded(newMinted, mintLimit[msg.sender]);
        }

        // Update vault currentMinted
        currentMinted[msg.sender] = newMinted;

        // Mint TAU to recipient
        _mint(recipient, amount); // UNLIMITED MINT, SINCE ONLY MSG.SENDER IS ACCOUNTED
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Considier limiting ```recipient``` address or not allowing to mint to someone else by minting only to ```msg.sender```
