# Error by keepers will results in loss of yield

## Summary
Wrong encoded swap params sent by keepers may results in loss of yields.

## Vulnerability Detail:
Vault has method named `swapForTau()`. Keeper call this method to swap the yields for `Tau`.   `yieldTokenAmount` and `swapParams` are two of params passed to this method.  `yieldTokenAmount` minus fee is transferred to swapAdapter.  If keeper set `amountIn` less than `yieldTokenAmount` in encoded `swapParams` then it will results in loss of yield because actual swap is done for amountIn set in `swapParams` not on transferred amount.  After swap is done, some tokens will remain in the swapAdapter contract and anyone can swap those out.

## Impact
Loss of yield to users of vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use maxOf(tokenIn.balanceOf(addressThis), amountIn) to swap for `_outputToken` in swap adapter ( UniswapSwapAdapter.sol ).
```solidity
function swap(address _outputToken, bytes calldata _swapData) external returns (uint256) {
       // Decode swap data
        (uint256 deadline, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOutMinimum, bytes memory _path) = abi.decode(
            _swapData,
            (uint256, uint256, uint256, bytes)
        );
      // Use below fix.
      // address tokenIn = // parse _swapData to fetch tokenIn
      // _amountIn = maxOf(IERC20(tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this), _amountIn);
     .....
}
```
