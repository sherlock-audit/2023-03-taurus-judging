# Wrong calculation of collateral ratio with the collateral tokens which are not in decimals 18

## Summary
Wrong calculation of collateral ratio with the collateral tokens which has decimals < 18
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `_computeCR` in library `TauMath` is used to calculate the collateral ratio of an account. But the formula in this function will be incorrect if collateral tokens has `decimals` != 18.
```solidity=
uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals);
```
TAU token is the debt token, which is in 18 decimals. But the collateral can be not in decimals 18, example WBTC is in 8 decimals. Then this formula will calculate incorrectly the ratio for these token, since the decimals of token is not mentioned.
Example: 
* Token WBTC is in 8 decimals, and the Oracle is Chainlink WBTC-USD, which has `priceDecimals` = 8
* Assume price of 1 WBTC is 20000$, it means `price` = 20000 * 1e8
* The collRatio of 1 WBTC (1e8 wei) and 1 TAU debt (1e18 wei) is:
```solidity=
(_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals)
= 1e8 * (20000 * 1e8) * 1e18 / (1e18 * 1e8)
= 20000 * 1e8
```
* It's very small ratio of `Constants.PRECISION` (1e18), and it's incorrect since WBTC is very expensive.

There is a similar problem when convert debt asset (TAU tokens) to collateral in function `_calcLiquidation` of contract `BaseVault.sol`: 
```solidity=
uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * (10 ** decimals)) / price;
```

## Impact
Collateral tokens which has < 18 decimals (like WBTC) can't be supported. It's very bad behavior since the sponsors confirm that Taurus was built having in mind to support any collateral tokens.

## Recommendation
Convert collateral amount to decimals 18 before calculation.
