# Due to spot pricing and volatile prices, users can get immediately liquidated.

## Summary

The GLPPriceOracle used by the GMXYieldAdapter vault does not have a deviation threshold and does not have heartbeat checks. As a result, users are vulnerable to immediate liquidation due to spot pricing and volatile prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The GMXYieldAdapter vault is using the GLPPriceOracle to fetch the current price of GLP when calculating the collateral ratio.

```solidity
  function getLatestPrice(
        bytes calldata _maximise
    )
        external
        view
        override
        returns (uint256 _currentPrice, uint256 _lastPrice, uint256 _lastUpdateTimestamp, uint8 _decimals)
    {
        bool isMax = _maximise.parse32BytesToBool();
        uint256 price = glpManager.getPrice(isMax);
        return (price, price, block.timestamp, decimals);
    }
```

```solidity
   function _getCollPrice() internal view virtual returns (uint256 price, uint8 decimals) {
        bool success;

        // Fetch the price from oracle manager
        (price, decimals, success) = PriceOracleManager(
            Controller(controller).addressMapper(Constants.PRICE_ORACLE_MANAGER)
        ).getExternalPrice(collateralToken, abi.encodePacked(false));
        if (!success) {
            revert oracleCorrupt();
        }
    }
```


Then, the GLPManager calculates the price using the following formula.

$$price = \dfrac{aum * 1e18}{glpTotalSupply}$$

```solidity
    function getPrice(bool _maximise) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 aum = getAum(_maximise);
        uint256 supply = IERC20(glp).totalSupply();
        return aum.mul(GLP_PRECISION).div(supply);
    }
```

As per GMX docs,

The price of GLP is based on the total worth of all tokens in the pool and factors in pending profits and losses from all currently opened positions.
-   Buy price: `glpManager.getPrice(true)`
-   Sell price: `glpManager.getPrice(false)`

The issue arrises because of two reasons:
1. It's expected and normal for GLP to change frequently, because the total worth of all tokens in the pool is constantly changing.
2. the GLPPriceOracle doesn't have a deviation threshold and practically has no heartbeat checks because block.timestamp is returned every time it is called.

```solidity
return (price, price, block.timestamp, decimals);
```

This is problematic, because the GMX LP Price is quite volatile and can change significantly on every minute. I've used [this](https://app.zerion.io/tokens/91fd93c4-8187-4afb-9e51-b6b1c781ac5a) website to collect some data from today.

Consider the following case:
1. Alice deposits 1.21e18 collateral and takes 1e18 debt. Her account is healthy.
2. Immediately after her transaction is executed, the price drops by 0.50% and she gets liquidated.


## Impact

Due to spot pricing and volatile prices, users can get immediately liquidated.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the team should consider implementing a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Oracle. This way, borrowers and liquidators will have "equal chances" to transact at the same price over a defined period of time, which would reduce the impact of sudden price changes. Additionally, the GLPPriceOracle should be updated to include a deviation threshold and heartbeat checks to ensure that the price of GLP is not too volatile and that the Oracle remains operational.
