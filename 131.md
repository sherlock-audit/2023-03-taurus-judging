# Address.isContract() is not a reliable way of checking if the input is an EOA

## Summary
There are some places in the code where transactions will revert due to `Address.isContract()`
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
CustomOracleWrapper.sol#L25
    ) external isContract(_customOracleAddress) onlyOwner {

```

[CustomOracleWrapper.sol#L25](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/Wrapper/CustomOracleWrapper.sol#L25)

Same here

[PriceOracleManager.sol#L28](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/PriceOracleManager.sol#L28)
[PriceOracleManager.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/PriceOracleManager.sol#L36)

## Impact
It is not allowed to add non-EOA representative as a `glpManager`, `wrapperAddress`, `customOracleAddress`
But, this limitation can be bypassed by rotating representatives.
## Code Snippet
Below is a simple example of salted contract creation, which you can test against _isContract(address) function.


```solidity
contract Address {
    function isContract(address account) external view returns (bool) {
        // This method relies on extcodesize/address.code.length, which returns 0
        // for contracts in construction, since the code is only stored at the end
        // of the constructor execution.

        return account.code.length > 0;
    }
}

contract AttackerContract {
    function destroy() external {
        selfdestruct(payable(0));
    }
}

contract AttackerFactory {
    function deploy() external returns (address) {
        return address(new AttackerContract{salt: bytes32("123")}());
    }
}

```

## Recommendation
One of the goals of Ethereum is for humans and smart contracts to both be treated equally. This leads into a future where smart contracts interact seamlessly with humans and other contracts. It might change in the future , but for now an arbitrary address is ambiguous.
