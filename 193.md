# Collateral ratio calculation is incorrect if `collateralToken` isn't in 18 decimals

## Summary
Some calculations in the contracts are incorrect if the collateral token has less or more than 18 decimals.
Since the protocol wants to add other yield bearing tokens in the future, this will cause large losses of funds if the token doesn't have 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_computeCR()` in `TauMath.sol` will give an incorrect collateral ratio if the collateral token doesn't have 18 decimals.

For example, if the collateral token XYZ has 8 decimals and the price feed has 8 decimals, the debt is 1000 TAU, and the collateral is 1000 XYZ and the price is 1 XYZ = 1 TAU, then 

```solidity
uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals) = (1000 * 1e8 * 1e8 * 1e18) / (1000 * 1e18 * 10**8) = 1e8

```
The value expected is 1e18 but the calculation gives 1e8. This will cause the collateral ratio to be much smaller than expected leading to early liquidations of users.

If decimals is bigger than 18, then the collateral ratio will be much larger than expected, allowing users to take undercollateralized loan and steal TAU from the contract.

## Impact
Loss of user funds due to collateral ratio larger or smaller than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `TauMath.sol`:

```solidity
    function _computeCR(
        uint256 _coll,
        uint256 _debt,
        uint256 _price,
+       uint8 collDecimals,
+       uint8 debtDecimals,     
        uint8 priceDecimals
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (_debt > 0) {
-           uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals);            
+           uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION * debtDecimals) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals * collDecimals);

            return newCollRatio;
        }
        // Return the maximal value for uint256 if the account has a debt of 0. Represents "infinite" CR.
        else {
            // if (_debt == 0)
            return type(uint256).max;
        }
    }
}
```

In `BaseVault:_calcLiquidation`:



```solidity
-       uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * (10 ** decimals)) / price;
+       uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * collateralToken.decimals() * (10 ** decimals)) / (price * debtToken.decimals());

```
