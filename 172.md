# Addresses array can be spammed

## Summary
Someone can add infinite users to userAddresses although the added addresses are not related with Taurus protocol in any way.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call this function behalf of anyone. A malicious person could use this function for arbitrary addresses and add their address on the address array. It also updates the userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral however, it is not abusable for any action.

One potential scenario where this can hurt the system:
This function starts looping around the userAddresses array from a given index up to index+offset which offset is determined by multisig. If the array length increases a lot, liquidation bot will have hard times fetching the unhealthy accounts. Also, userAddresses should only involves the users who are using the Taurus protocol. However, this way, by continuously calling updateReward for random addresses that has nothing to do with Taurus someone can add these users to the array counting them as Taurus protocols users.
