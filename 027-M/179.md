# DoS on `_disburseTau()`

## Summary
Due to rounding, if calls to `distributeTauRewards()` or `disburseTau()` are frequent enough, zero `TAU` tokens will be distributed and `_disburseTau()` can be DoS until more `TAU` is added to `tauWithheld`.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the intervals between calls to  `_disburseTau()` are short and there is little `TAU` to be distributed, then `_tokensToDisburse = (_timeElapsed * tauWithheld) / DRIP_DURATION;` can get 0, therefore no tokens will be distributed but the `tokensLastDisbursedTimestamp` will be updated, as shown in `_disburseTau()`'s snippet below. Consequently, while this interval is kept short, no `TAU` will be distributed until more `TAU` (enough to make `_tokensToDisburse` > 0) is added for distribution. 

```javascript
uint256 _timeElapsed = block.timestamp - tokensLastDisbursedTimestamp;
uint256 _tokensToDisburse;
if (_timeElapsed >= DRIP_DURATION) {
    _tokensToDisburse = tauWithheld;
    tauWithheld = 0;
} else {
    _tokensToDisburse = (_timeElapsed * tauWithheld) / DRIP_DURATION;
    tauWithheld -= _tokensToDisburse;
}
// Divide by current collateral to get the additional tokensPerCollateral which we'll be adding to the cumulative sum
uint256 _extraRewardPerCollateral = (_tokensToDisburse * Constants.PRECISION) / _currentCollateral;
cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral += _extraRewardPerCollateral;
tokensLastDisbursedTimestamp = block.timestamp;
```

An attacker can keep calling `disburseTau()` or `distributeTauRewards(0)`  at each block, triggering `_disburseTau()`. If  
`tauWithheld` amount is low enough, he will be able to DoS distribution until sufficient `TAU` is added to `tauWithheld` (either by `swapForTau` or `distributeTauRewards`), as explained above.

## Impact
An attacker can DoS `_disburseTau()` on specific circumstances, blocking the `self-repayment` of loans, therefore affecting one key functionality of the protocol. Classifying this as a medium, because it only works when `tauWithheld` amounts are low, but it can block `_disburseTau()` indefinitely if there are no more `TAU` added to `tauWithheld`.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Consider adding acess controls to `disburseTau()`, allowing only specified roles to call it., and define a min amount of `TAU` to be burned in each call to `distributeTauRewards()` (as shown in the diff below), making this attack more expensive to the attacker.
