# The protocol would be exposed to risk in cases of adverse liquidation

## Summary
Liquidations sometimes amplifies the risk of insolvency. Ideally, when partial liquidation occurs, it should increase the collateral ratio of the account being liquidated. In return, liquidators get a share of the collateral as incentive. However, if liquidation is too low, the liquidation cost might further drive towards insolvency. 
The current liquidation discount of Tau is 1.05 as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L391 meaning that the borrowers debt increases to at least `1 / 1.05 = 95.2%` of the value of Tau which means each liquidation action pushes the account further towards insolvency. 
Consider the following scenario :
1. A borrower is under and they have a debt of $100, with collateral of $100 ad their current collateral ratio is 100%.
2.  For a liquidator to repay $50 of debt, they need to receive 105% of the debt meaning they will receive $52.5 of the debt. 
3. Therefore, the new debt would be $50, collateral  $47.5 and the new collateral ratio  will be 95%.
With this partial liquidation adversely increases the risk of insolvency.
