# `userAddresses` array allows duplication of users

## Summary

`userAddresses` array allows duplication of users

## Vulnerability Detail

Users are added to the `userAddresses` array in the `BaseVault::updateReward` function if the `_userCollateral` is not geater than zero:

```solidity
modifier updateReward(address _account) {
        // Disburse available yield from the drip feed
        _disburseTau();

        // If user has collateral, pay down their debt and recycle surplus rewards back into the tauDripFeed.
        uint256 _userCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
        if (_userCollateral > 0) {
            // Get diff between global rewardPerCollateral and user lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
            uint256 _rewardDiff = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral -
                userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral;

            // Calculate user's TAU earned since the last update, use it to pay off debt
            uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION;

            if (_tauEarned > 0) {
                uint256 _userDebt = userDetails[_account].debt;
                if (_tauEarned > _userDebt) {
                    // If user has earned more than enough TAU to pay off their debt, pay off debt and add surplus to drip feed
                    userDetails[_account].debt = 0;

                    _withholdTau(_tauEarned - _userDebt);
                    _tauEarned = _userDebt;
                } else {
                    // Pay off as much debt as possible
                    userDetails[_account].debt = _userDebt - _tauEarned;
                }

                emit TauEarned(_account, _tauEarned);
            }
        } else {
            // If this is a new user, add them to the userAddresses array to keep track of them.
            if (userDetails[_account].startTimestamp == 0) {
                userAddresses.push(_account);
                userDetails[_account].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            }
        }

        // Update user lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
        userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral;
        _;
    }
```

The issue is that a check is never done to determine whether an `_account` already exists in the array. Therefore there are instances where duplication will occur. For instance, if a new user calls the `modifyPosition` function multiple times without providing collateral. Another instance would be if a user had previously withdrawn all their collateral.

## Impact

The `userDetails` array is a key element of the protocol and is relied on by multiple functions including the `getUsersCount` function which would be broken.

## Recommendation

Check whether an account exists in the `userAddresses` array before adding it.
