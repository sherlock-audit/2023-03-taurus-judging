# Potential Integer Overflow in _computeCR()



## Summary
If the multiplication of `(_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) ` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `uint256` variable, an integer overflow may occur.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Libs/TauMath.sol#L18

Let's assume the following input values for the  `_computeCR()`,

```solidity
_coll = 2**255 // maximum uint256 value divided by 2
_debt = 1
_price = 1
priceDecimals = 18
```
In this case, the multiplication of  `_coll, _price, and Constants.PRECISION ` will be,
```solidity
(_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) = (2**255 * 1 * 10**18) = 2**273
```
This value is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` variable, which is `2^256 - 1`. 
As a result, an integer overflow will occur, and the actual result will be,
```solidity
(_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) % (2**256) = 0
```
This value is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.


## Impact
The result of the computation can be incorrect, leading to incorrect decisions. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_To mitigate this issue,_ 
the code can perform  checks on the input values before performing the multiplication. 
For example, 
the code can checks that `_coll,` `_debt`,` _price`, and `Constants.PRECISION` are all less than or equal to `2**128 - 1`, which is the square root of the maximum value of `uint256`.
