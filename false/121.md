# Arbitrary external call of `FeeSplitter`

## Summary

In `distributeFees`, the address of external call is controlled by users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_token` parameter passed by user is used for arbitrary call almost without any check. Since this function is just `external` and so that can be called by anyone, this is dangerous.
```solidity
function distributeFees(address _token) external {
        uint256 feeAmount = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (feeAmount == 0) return;

        uint256 _numFeeRecipients = numFeeRecipients;
        for (uint256 i; i < _numFeeRecipients; ++i) {
            FeeRecipient memory feeRecipient = feeRecipients[i];
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
                feeRecipient.recipient,
                (feeAmount * feeRecipient.proportion) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION
            );
        }
    }
```

## Impact

After some research I did not find a valid attack vector for this vulnerability, but since this contract does hold some user tokens from vaults, I still though this vulnerability to be dangerous and decide to submit it and marked it as MEDIUM.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add token whitelist to `FeeSplitter`, or add things like `onlyMultisig/onlyRecipient` to this function.
