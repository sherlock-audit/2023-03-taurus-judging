# TauDripFeed does not init controller

## Summary

The TauDripFeed abstract contract inherits from `ControllableUpgradeable` but does not init the controller via `__Controllable_init`.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is currently not problematic as the only place TauDripFeed is used is in the base vault which calls `__Controllable_init` in `__BaseVault_init`. However this behaviour is error prone if other contracts become developed where `TauDripFeed` is inherited from outside of `BaseVault`.

## Impact

If `controller` is not set in TauDripFeed, the `onlyMultisig` modifier will always revert and the contract will not be able to be paused.

## Code Snippet

TauDripFeed is ControllableUpgradeable:
