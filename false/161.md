# `swapForTau()` doesn't check whether `_yieldTokenAmount == _amountIn`. The keeper can easily take all tokens out from the vault. Everyone can also take the rest of the tokens.

## Summary

`swapForTau()` doesn't check whether `_yieldTokenAmount == _amountIn`. The keeper can easily take all tokens out from the vault. Everyone can also take the rest of the tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the comments of `SwapHandler.swapForTau()`:

```text
@param _yieldTokenAmount is the amount of yield token. Some will be transferred to the FeeSplitter for use by the protocol. The rest will be swapped for tau.
```

If the keeper set `_yieldTokenAmount` to 1,000, but only set 100 `_amountIn` in `_swapParams`, then the 900 tokens will remain in `UniswapSwapAdapter` because these tokens have been sent to the adapter (For better explanation, ignore the protocol fees for now):

```solidity
        // Transfer tokens to swap adapter
        IERC20(_yieldTokenAddress).safeTransfer(swapAdapterAddress, swapAmount);
```

Then, everyone can call `UniswapSwapAdapter.swap()` to take the rest of these tokens. The keeper can easily use this vulnerability to take all tokens out from the vault.

## Impact

Everyone can take the rest of the tokens. The keeper can easily take all tokens out from the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check `_yieldTokenAmount == _amountIn` in `SwapHandler.swapForTau()`.
Or use `IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))` rather than `_amountIn` in `UniswapSwapAdapter.swap()`.
