# Some ERC20 tokens deduct a fee on transfer

## Summary
Some ERC20 token implementations have a fee that is charged on each token transfer. This means that the transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

The protocol currently uses any ERC20 tokens:

> ERC20:  any non-rebasing


## Vulnerability Detail
See Summary

## Impact
The transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

```solidity
310: IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _collateralDelta);
319: IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _collateralDelta);
379: IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralToLiquidator);
380: IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Improve support for fee on transfer type of ERC20. When pulling funds from the user using `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` the usual approach is to compare balances pre/post transfer, like so:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 transferred = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```
