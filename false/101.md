# Fee on transfer tokens will not behave as expected

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens.
When a fee is charged on a transfer of tokens in Solidity, it is important to check the balance of the sender's account before and after the transfer to ensure that the fee has been correctly deducted from the sender's balance.

If this check is not performed, it can result in an accounting error where the sender's balance is overstated, leading to potential issues with record keeping, reporting, and reconciliation.
## Impact
This kind of fee on transfer token does not work correctly with the `_modifyPosition` and `distributeFees`

## Code Snippet
Issue in BaseVault.sol#L319 & FeeSplitter.sol#L35 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L319
```solidity
                // Withdraw collateral
                uint256 currentCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
                if (_collateralDelta > currentCollateral) revert insufficientCollateral();
                userDetails[_account].collateral = currentCollateral - _collateralDelta;
                mustCheckHealth = true;
                IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _collateralDelta); //@audit receive less than _collateralDelta.
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Tokenomics/FeeSplitter.sol#L35
```solidity
            FeeRecipient memory feeRecipient = feeRecipients[i];
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(   //@audit receive less than calculated amount.
                feeRecipient.recipient,
                (feeAmount * feeRecipient.proportion) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION
            );
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
it's recommended to always check the balances before and after any transfer with fees to ensure accurate accounting.
