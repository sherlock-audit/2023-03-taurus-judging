# Due to lack of validation, the protocol lose an opportunity to collect the protocol fee when the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` would be called

## Summary
Due to lack of validation,  the protocol lose an opportunity to collect the protocol fee when the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` would be called.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Constants library,
the `GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE` would be defined as a name of the protocol fee for GLP vault like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Libs/Constants.sol#L33
```solidity
    // Fee names
    // Fraction of yield from GLP vault which will be sent to the feeSplitter, i.e. the protocol. Precision is PERCENT_PRECISION.
    bytes32 internal constant GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE = keccak256("GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE");
```

Within the FeeMapping,
the mapping storage of the `feeMapping` would be defined in order to keep track of fee types like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/FeeMapping.sol#L12
```solidity
    /// @dev keep track of fee types being used by the vault
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) internal feeMapping;
```

Within the FeeMapping#`addFeePerc()`,
each `_perc` (portion) of fee would be associated with each `_feeType` of the `feeMapping` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/FeeMapping.sol#L22
```solidity
    /// @dev add the fee types being used by the vault
    /// note if we want to delete the mapping, pass _feeType with empty array
    function addFeePerc(bytes32[] memory _feeType, uint256[] memory _perc) public onlyMultisig {
        uint256 _feeTypeLength = _feeType.length;
        if (_feeTypeLength != _perc.length) revert indexOutOfBound();

        for (uint256 i; i < _feeTypeLength; ++i) {
            if (_perc[i] > Constants.MAX_FEE_PERC) revert feePercTooLarge();
            feeMapping[_feeType[i]] = _perc[i];  /// @audit
        }
    }
```

Within the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()`,
the `protocolFees` would be calculated by using the `feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE]` and then the `protocolFees` would be deducted from the `_yieldTokenAmount` to calculate the `swapAmount` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/SwapHandler.sol#L70-L72
```solidity
    function swapForTau(
        address _yieldTokenAddress,
        uint256 _yieldTokenAmount,
        uint256 _minTauReturned,
        bytes32 _swapAdapterHash,
        uint256 _rewardProportion,
        bytes calldata _swapParams
    ) external onlyKeeper whenNotPaused {
        ...
        // Calculate portion of tokens which will be swapped for TAU and disbursed to the vault, and portion which will be sent to the protocol.
        uint256 protocolFees = (feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE] * _yieldTokenAmount) /  /// @audit
            Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION;
        uint256 swapAmount = _yieldTokenAmount - protocolFees;
        ...
```

At the line of the calculation of `protocolFees` within the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` above, some value (portion) is supposed to be assigned into the `feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE]` the FeeMapping#`addFeePerc()` before the calculation of `protocolFees` would be executed.

However, there is no validation to check wether or not the `feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE]` would be `0`. 
If the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` would be called before some value (portion) would be assigned into the `feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE]` via the FeeMapping#`addFeePerc()`, the result of the calculation of the `protocolFees` would be always `0`. 

example). 
Let's say the `_yieldTokenAmount` would be 10 (10 * 1e18). 
The calculation process of the `protocolFees` within the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` would be like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/SwapHandler.sol#L70-L71
```solidity
uint256 protocolFees = (feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE] * _yieldTokenAmount) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION;
uint256 protocolFees = (0 * _yieldTokenAmount) / 1e18
uint256 protocolFees = (0 * (10 * 1e18)) / 1e18
uint256 protocolFees = 0
```

## Impact
This lead to losing an opportunity for the protocol to collect the protocol fee when the SwapHandler#`swapForTau()` would be called.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation in order to check wether or not the `feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE]` would be `0` before the calculation of the `protocolFees` would be done like this:
```solidity
    function swapForTau(
        address _yieldTokenAddress,
        uint256 _yieldTokenAmount,
        uint256 _minTauReturned,
        bytes32 _swapAdapterHash,
        uint256 _rewardProportion,
        bytes calldata _swapParams
    ) external onlyKeeper whenNotPaused {
        ...
        // Calculate portion of tokens which will be swapped for TAU and disbursed to the vault, and portion which will be sent to the protocol.
+       require(feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE] != 0, "Some portion of the protocol fee for the GLP vault must be more than 0");
        uint256 protocolFees = (feeMapping[Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE] * _yieldTokenAmount) / 
            Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION;
        uint256 swapAmount = _yieldTokenAmount - protocolFees;
        ...
```
