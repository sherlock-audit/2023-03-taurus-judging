# Oracle Manipulation

## Summary
Manipulatable oracle feed on GMX's `getPrice` function!
## Vulnerability Detail
This function is very critical which determines the collateral price on the vault logic. GMX has various ways to calculate the price of  GLP.

If https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts/blob/69c810984b63b055f435e78e6e5a9654dd2b84cc/contracts/core/VaultPriceFeed.sol#L167
This is true (`_includeAmmPrice` is default to true usually), amm price will be included to price calculation. Since AMM price is basic univ2 it is easily manipulatable. In default, TAU contracts always sends the `_maximise` as false, so there is a possibility to make this if check true https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts/blob/69c810984b63b055f435e78e6e5a9654dd2b84cc/contracts/core/VaultPriceFeed.sol#L173-L174
Someone can flash loan and manipulate the price so that price will return smaller than it should be. TAU contracts will count the collat price lower which is used on liquidations. Some attacker can flash loan and manipulate the oracle so that price is lower accounted on Taurus contracts and then tries to liquidate some other user although the user is not liquidatable. 

GMX is using their pricing logic so that when a user sells an asset it gets the minimum price, and when an user buys an asset it gets the maximum price, hence, there are no room for benefits of flash loan manipulations for any attacker. However, Taurus relies on their price on both up and down movement. Taurus only calls the getPrice with “false” input, which is for selling and it is always looks for the smaller price in GMX contracts. However, Taurus relies on the price, if an attacker can make the price return smaller than it is, attacker can liquidate someone since the logic is used for that.
