# Assumption that TAU coin is $1

## Summary
In checking the account health via `getAccountHealth ()` function, the contract assumes that the price of TAU stablecoin to be $1. This is evident as seen in the code comments of the function as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L122-L128
## Vulnerability Detail
The code inaccurately assumes that the price of TAU to be $1. Stablecoins can depeg which is evident with the current debacle of USDC and previously UST. 
The contract should fetch the price of TAU directly via oracles
## Impact
In the event that TAU depegs then it would be devastating to the protocol opening up massive arbitrage opportunities.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider directly querying the price of TAU via price oracles.
