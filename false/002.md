# Owner can renounce himself leaving contract without owner.

## Summary
Current implementation of contract lets the owner to be able to call ```renounceOwnership``` method which is ```public``` leaving contracts implementing ```Ownable``` without owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

To the following functions is attached modifier ```onlyOwner```, losing ownership will make them uncallable:

```solidity
taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/CustomPriceOracle/CustomPriceOracle.sol

39: function registerTrustedNode(address _node) external checkNonZeroAddress(_node) onlyOwner
44: function unregisterTrustedNode(address _node) external checkNonZeroAddress(_node) onlyOwner

taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/CustomPriceOracle/GLPPriceOracle.sol

47: function setGlpManager(address _glpManager) external onlyOwner

taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/PriceOracleManager.sol

27: function setWrapper(address _underlying, address _wrapperAddress) external override onlyOwner
36: function updateWrapper(address _underlying, address _wrapperAddress) external override onlyOwner

taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/Wrapper/CustomOracleWrapper.sol

22: function addOracle(
        address _underlying,
        address _customOracleAddress
    ) external isContract(_customOracleAddress) onlyOwner

31: function removeOracle(address _underlying) external onlyOwner
```

## Impact

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/PriceOracleManager.sol#L5

```solidity
    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommended to make the function ```internal``` or remove it.
