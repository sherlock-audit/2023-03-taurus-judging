# Attackers can disable vault deposits for all users

## Summary
High
Attackers can force vault's currentMinted excess mintLimit by repeatly adding and removing debts.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users add or remove debts via modify() function with amount _debtDelta and bool _increaseDebt. If _increaseDebt is true, the vault will execute Tau.mint(userAddress, amount ). Otherwise the vault will execute Tau.burnFrom(userAddress, debtAmount).


The problem is that in the burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) check the account 's currentMinted value instead of the vault's (msg.sender). Because of that, the accountMinted value will be always 0 and the code will skip reducing the burned amount from the vault's currentMinted.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L76-L83

The final result is that vault's currentMinted value is never updated when users remove their debts via modifyPosition().

## Impact
Anyone could easily DOS the vault by writing a simple contract that continously adding and removing debts until being reverted. Since vault's currentMinted value is never updated after debts being removed, it will excess vault's mintLimit eventually.
## Code Snippet

Test:
```js
it.only("Should reduce currentMinted", async () => {
      await tau.connect(vaultPlaceholder).mint(deployer.address, 1000);
      await tau.connect(deployer).approve(vaultPlaceholder.address, 1000);
      await tau.connect(vaultPlaceholder).burnFrom(deployer.address, 1000);
      expect(await tau.currentMinted(vaultPlaceholder.address)).to.equal(0);
    });
```
Result:
 0 passing (5s)
  1 failing

  1) TAU token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
 function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[msg.sender];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - `amount;`
        }
    }
```
