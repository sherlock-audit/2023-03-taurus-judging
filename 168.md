# Malicious keepers

## Summary
A malicious keeper can advantage the `swapForTau` function and take the yield tokens to pocket instead of selling for TAU
## Vulnerability Detail
There are no checks on keepers _minTauReturned and _yieldTokenAmount values. Malicious keeper can swap rewards with inputting the _minTauReturned as 0 and the swap the keeper does will be sandwitched since there are no slippage tolerance.

  Example:  Assume 1WETH = 1000TAU, 
  Keeper will give the `_minTauReturned` as 1. 
  1 WETH will be sent to swap adapter contract after keeper tx. 
  Since swap data also generated by keeper, keeper will only swap to achieve 1 TAU output. 
  Rest of the WETH will be idle on swap contract. 
  Then keeper will call the swap contract and pocket the remaining ETH since swap contract is sending the funds from its internal balance to `msg.sender`.
