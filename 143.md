# Inconsistency of `msg.sender` and `_account` in `TAU._decreaseCurrentMinted`

## Summary

In `TAU._decreaseCurrentMinted`, when `_collateralDelta != 0`, it transfers to/from `msg.sender` rather than the specified `_account`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TAU._decreaseCurrentMinted`:
```solidity
function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
    }
```

In fact, it's difficult to decide we should decrease the `currentMinted` from which one, since there are some vaults designated by governance, and each one could mint TAU to arbitrary users. So we cannot know who is responsible to these minted token. Just decrease from `msg.sender` seems not a good idea.

## Impact


In some cases, this will make some vaults get unexpectedly more power to mint and decrease the mint power to some vaults who run the `burn` or decrease. Anyway, it's some unexpected behaviour, so I marked it as Medium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider having another state variable(mapping? nested mapping?) to record who is responsible for the minted TAU of this account.
