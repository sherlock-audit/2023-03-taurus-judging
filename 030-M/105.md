# A potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vulnerability due to unrestricted iteration over a large array in the fetchUnhealthyAccounts function

## Summary
The potential DoS attack vulnerability in `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function is caused by the fact that it retrieves a potentially large array of user accounts from `vault.getUsers` function and then iterates over every element in the array, which may cause the function to consume a large amount of gas and potentially run out of gas. 

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intentionally passing a large `_startIndex` value to the function and setting the health of all accounts in the array to `false`. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function could be modified to limit the size of the array returned by the `vault.getUsers ` function or otherwise limit the amount of work that the function needs to perform.

## Vulnerability Detail
Please pay attention to the `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function,
```solidity
   function fetchUnhealthyAccounts(
        uint256 _startIndex,
        address _vaultAddress
    ) external view returns (address[] memory unhealthyAccounts) {
        BaseVault vault = BaseVault(_vaultAddress);
        address[] memory accounts = vault.getUsers(_startIndex, _startIndex + offset);
        uint256 j;

        for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; ++i) {
            if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) j++;
        }

        unhealthyAccounts = new address[](j);
        j = 0;

        for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) unhealthyAccounts[j++] = accounts[i];
        }

        return unhealthyAccounts;
    }
```
1. Let's say,  `vault.getUsers` function returns an array of 1 million addresses.

2. The attacker calls the `fetchUnhealthyAccounts ` function with a large `_startIndex` value, such as 900,000.

3. The `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function then retrieves the accounts array by calling` vault.getUsers``(_startIndex, _startIndex + offset)`. Since `offset` is not defined in the code, we'll assume that it defaults to  `0`.

4. The `accounts` array now contains 100,000 addresses, starting from index 900,000.

5. The loop in the `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function iterates over every element in the `accounts` array, checking the health of each account by calling `vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])`.

6. Since there are 100,000 accounts in the `accounts` array, the loop will execute 100,000 times.

7. If the attacker's goal is to perform a DoS attack, they could intentionally set the health of every account in the `accounts `array to `false`, causing the loop to execute the maximum number of times possible.

8. Each iteration of the loop would then perform the `vault.getAccountHealth` function, which could be a complex or time-consuming operation. 

9. As the loop continues to execute, it could consume more and more gas, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas and fail.

10. If the transaction fails, the attacker could simply repeat the process with a different `_startIndex` value, causing the loop to execute with a different set of accounts each time.


## Impact
 The DoS attack can disrupt the entire system or cause significant financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To solve the issue, we can modify the `vault.getUsers` function to limit the maximum number of accounts returned based on ` _startIndex` value and a maximum limit. 

Here's an example implementation -
```solidity
function getUsers(uint256 _startIndex, uint256 _maxCount) external view returns (address[] memory) {
    uint256 totalCount = userCount();

    if (_startIndex >= totalCount) {
        return new address[](0);
    }

    uint256 count = Math.min(_maxCount, totalCount - _startIndex);
    address[] memory users = new address[](count);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        users[i] = userList[_startIndex + i];
    }

    return users;
}
```
In the above-modified implementation,

 Includes a new `_maxCount` parameter, which limits the maximum number of accounts that can be returned by the function. 

The function first checks if  `_startIndex` value is greater than or equal to the total number of `users`, 
in which case it returns an empty array. 

If  `_startIndex` value is within range, the function calculates the maximum number of accounts that can be returned based on  `_maxCount` parameter and the total number of `users`, and then creates a new array of that size. 

Finally, the function populates the array with the appropriate user addresses and returns it.

Now we can update the `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function to include  `_maxCount` parameter when calling `vault.getUsers ` function,

```solidity
function fetchUnhealthyAccounts(
    uint256 _startIndex,
    address _vaultAddress,
    uint256 _maxCount
) external view returns (address[] memory unhealthyAccounts) {
    BaseVault vault = BaseVault(_vaultAddress);
    address[] memory accounts = vault.getUsers(_startIndex, _maxCount);
    uint256 j;

    for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; ++i) {
        if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) j++;
    }

    unhealthyAccounts = new address[](j);
    j = 0;

    for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) unhealthyAccounts[j++] = accounts[i];
    }

    return unhealthyAccounts;
}
```

Now  `fetchUnhealthyAccounts` function will only retrieve a maximum of `_maxCount` user accounts from the `vault.getUsers` function, which should help prevent a DoS attack.
 We can adjust the value of `_maxCount` as needed to balance security and performance considerations.
