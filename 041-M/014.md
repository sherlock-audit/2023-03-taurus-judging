# TAU.sol: Governance address cannot be changed

## Summary
The `TAU` contract allows to set the `governance` address in its constructor.
This is the address that is able to call `setMintLimit` function.
The function is very important for the protocol because it manages which vaults can mint how much TAU.

The issue is that the `governance` address cannot be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the contest page, the governance address may have to change:
> Governance. Entirely trusted. This role will be initially granted to the multisig.

Governance is initially the multisig but it should be possible to change it later on.

## Impact
The `governance` of the `TAU` contract cannot be changed.
This makes it impossible to change governance of the protocol since `TAU` is probably the most important part of all in the protocol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement functionality such that `governance` can transfer its role to another address.
Maybe make use of the `controller` that the Vault makes use of for access controls such that all roles are managed in one place.
