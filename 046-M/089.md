# BaseVault: liquidationSurcharge amount is too high if collateralToLiquidate gets capped

## Summary
According to the comment explaining the `LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE` percentage, it should be a percentage of the liquidated amount:
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L64-L65)
```solidity
// 2% of the liquidated amount is sent to the FeeSplitter to fund protocol stability
// and disincentivize self-liquidation
```

So if say $100 of collateral is liquidated, the surcharge should be $2. I will show how this is not true in some cases. I.e. the surcharge may be higher (even a lot higher).

I had a discussion about this with the sponsor and it was assessed that this is unintended behavior. The liquidation surcharge percentage breaks in the case that I will show.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's have a look at how the liquidation surcharge is calculated:
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L406-L421)
```solidity
        uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * (10 ** decimals)) / price;
        collateralToLiquidate = (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * totalLiquidationDiscount) / Constants.PRECISION;
        if (collateralToLiquidate > _accountCollateral) {
            collateralToLiquidate = _accountCollateral;
        }


        // Revert if requested liquidation amount is greater than allowed
        if (
            _debtToLiquidate >
            _getMaxLiquidation(_accountCollateral, _accountDebt, price, decimals, totalLiquidationDiscount)
        ) revert wrongLiquidationAmount();


        return (
            collateralToLiquidate,
            (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE) / Constants.PRECISION
        );
```
The `collateralToLiquidate` is calculated by multiplying `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount` by `totalLiquidationDiscount`.
And then it is capped at `_accountCollateral`. The cap is necessary because it is not possible to remove more collateral from the loan than there is left.

As part of the return statement, the `liquidationSurcharge` return value is calculated as `(collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE) / Constants.PRECISION`.

It becomes clear that this can result in a higher liquidation surcharge than expected:
Let `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount=$100`, `totalLiquidationDiscount=120%` (20% percent discount on the collateral).
Then `collateralToLiquidate=$100*120%=$120` and `liquidationSurcharge=$100*2%=$2`.

If however the `collateralToLiquidate` gets capped at say $50, then `liquidationSurcharge` is still calculated in the same way.
But the surcharge percentage would actually be `$2/$50=4%` instead of the expected 2%.

## Impact
The `liquidationSurcharge` that is charged to the liquidator by subtracting it from the collateral he receives may not be the 2% that it is supposed to. This means that the liquidator needs to pay a higher liquidation fee in some cases and ends up with less profit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is not obvious how this issue can be fixed because the surcharge percentage is not well defined for when `collateralToLiquidate > _accountCollateral` and the `collateralToLiquidate` is capped.

After all if this is the case then what should `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount` be?
Should the amount by which `collateralToLiquidate` is reduced due to the cap be taken from the discount or from `collateralToLiquidate` AND the discount.

In other words it is not clear what value to use to calculate the liquidation surcharge.

This has been discussed with the sponsor and they should look into different ways to modify the calculation by first firmly establishing how the liquidation surcharge is intended to behave.
