# Funds can be stolen from `UniswapSwapAdapter` if swap was satisfied only partially

## Summary
There can be scenarios where tokens transferred to `UniswapSwapAdapter` are only partially swapped for TAU. In that case, a certain amount remains on the contract and can be withdrawn by anyone

## Vulnerability Detail
In order to swap yield rewards for TAU `SwapHandler.swapForTau` function transfers yield tokens to `UniswapSwapAdapter` and calls `swap`. 
```solidity
        IERC20(_yieldTokenAddress).safeTransfer(swapAdapterAddress, swapAmount);

        // Call swap function, which will transfer resulting tau back to this contract and return the amount transferred.
        // Note that this contract does not check that the swap adapter has transferred the correct amount of tau. This check
        // is handled by the swap adapter, and for this reason any registered swap adapter must be a completely trusted contract.
        uint256 tauReturned = BaseSwapAdapter(swapAdapterAddress).swap(tau, _swapParams);
```

The amount of tokens to swap is passed in `_yieldTokenAmount` parameters, while swap parameters are in `_swapParams`.
```solidity
    function swapForTau(
        address _yieldTokenAddress,
        uint256 _yieldTokenAmount,
        uint256 _minTauReturned,
        bytes32 _swapAdapterHash,
        uint256 _rewardProportion,
        bytes calldata _swapParams    
    ) external onlyKeeper whenNotPaused {
```

`UniswapSwapAdapter` is supposed to perform a swap using *all* of the yield tokens sent to it and return "out" tokens back to `SwapHandler`. There can be scenarios where not all yield tokens are swapped, in which case they will remain on `UniswapSwapAdapter` and will be available for withdrawal by anyone since `swap` has no access control.

First scenario is if there was an inconsistency between `_yieldTokenAmount` and `_swapParams`. These parameters are not validated against each other. It is possible to pass `swapParams` with `_amountIn` much smaller than `_yieldTokenAmount`. It is an input validation issue, but one that leads to instant loss of funds and therefore can be considered "Medium".

Second scenario is in an unlikely case that liquidity pool is depleted and there are not enough TAU tokens to perform the swap fully. In this case, Uniswap will perform a partial swap and the unswapped yield tokens will remain on the contract.

## Impact
Tokens can be stolen from `UniswapSwapAdapter`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- validate `_yieldTokenAmount` and `_swapParams` against each other
- return tokens back to `SwapHandler` in case of a partial Uniswap swap
- consider restricting access for `UniswapSwapAdapter.swap`.
