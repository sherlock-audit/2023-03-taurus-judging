# Lack of Access Control in updateRewards() means anyone can manipulate an accounts Rewards

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail

The function `updateRewards(address _account)` is an external function that calls the internal modifier `updateReward(_account)` 

This means anyone could potentially update the rewards for any account, therefore producing unexpected behaviour for the protocol. They could also add a number of random new users to the protocol leading to a DOS attack.


## Impact

Because an attacker has access to this function,  they can perform the following actions:

-  Pay off debt and add surplus to drip feed
- Pay as much of the users debt as possible
- Or add new users to the userAddresses struct  


The last action is especially concerning as the user could essentially perform Denial of service attack by adding a number of  addresses to the protocol.

```solidity

} else {
            // If this is a new user, add them to the userAddresses array to keep track of them.
            if (userDetails[_account].startTimestamp == 0) {
                userAddresses.push(_account);
                userDetails[_account].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            }
```



## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L452


```solidity
function updateRewards(address _account) external whenNotPaused updateReward(_account) {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Comments above this function indicate the updateRewards function is only useful for keepers to update inactive accounts (thus redistributing their excess rewards to the vault).

This means only the keeper should Ideally be able to update rewards. So the use of an `onlyKeeper `modifier would mitigate uncessesary calls to `updateReward()`

```solidity

    modifier onlyKeeper() {
        if (!AccessControl(controller).hasRole(Constants.KEEPER_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert notKeeper();
        }
        _;
    }
    
    
    
    
  function updateRewards(address _account) external whenNotPaused onlyKeeper updateReward(_account) {}
    
    
    


```
