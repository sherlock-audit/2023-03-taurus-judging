# Account can not be liquidated when price fall by 99%.

## Summary
Liquidation fails when price fall by 99%.  

## Vulnerability Detail
`_calcLiquidation()` method has logic related to liquidations. This method calculate total liquidation discount,  collateral to liquidate and liquidation surcharge. All these calculations looks okay in normal scenarios but there is an edge case when liquidation fails if price crashes by 99% or more. In such scenario `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount` will be very large and calculated liquidation surcharge becomes greater than `collateralToLiquidate`

```solidity
uint256 collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount = (_debtToLiquidate * (10 ** decimals)) / price;
collateralToLiquidate = (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * totalLiquidationDiscount) / Constants.PRECISION;
if (collateralToLiquidate > _accountCollateral) {
            collateralToLiquidate = _accountCollateral;
}
uint256 liquidationSurcharge = (collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount * LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE) / Constants.PRECISION
```

Contract revert from below line hence liquidation will fail in this scenario.

```solidity
uint256 collateralToLiquidator = collateralToLiquidate - liquidationSurcharge;
```
## Impact
Liquidation fails when price crash  by 99% or more. Expected behaviour is that liquidation should be successful in all scenarios.

## Code Snippet
Block of code that has bug.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L396-L422

Below is POC that prove failed liquidation.
```js
it("should revert liquidation if an account is unhealthy and price crashed 99%", async () => {
        // Assume price is crashed 99%
        await glpOracle.updatePrice(PRECISION.mul(1).div(100));
        // check if the account is underwater
        const health = await gmxVault.getAccountHealth(user.address);
        expect(health).eq(false);

        // Check the liquidation amount
        const liqAmt = await gmxVault.getMaxLiquidation(user.address);

        // Mint some TAU to the liquidator and approve vault to spend it
        await mintHelper(liqAmt, liquidator.address);
        await tau.connect(liquidator).approve(gmxVault.address, liqAmt);
        const totalTauSupply = await tau.totalSupply();

        // liquidation will fail
        const tx = gmxVault.connect(liquidator).liquidate(user.address, liqAmt, 0);
        // reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)
        await expect(tx).revertedWithPanic(0x11);
      });
```
>PS: This test goes in 00_GmxYieldAdapter.ts and inside describe("Liquidate", async () => { block defined at line 269

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Presently liquidation surcharge is calculated on `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount`.  Project team may want to reconsider this logic and calculate surcharge on `collateralToLiquidate` instead of `collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount`. This will be business decision but easy fix

Another option is you may want to calculate surcharge on `Math.min(collateralToLiquidate, collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount)`.
 
```solidity
        uint256 collateralToTakeSurchargeOn = Math.min(collateralToLiquidate, collateralToLiquidateWithoutDiscount);
        uint256 liquidationSurcharge = (collateralToTakeSurchargeOn * LIQUIDATION_SURCHARGE) / Constants.PRECISION;
        return (collateralToLiquidate, liquidationSurcharge);
```
