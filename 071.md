# Oracle price is insufficiently validated, price without tolerance check

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When an oracle price is insufficiently validated, it means that the price provided by the oracle is not properly checked for accuracy or reliability before it is used to execute a smart contract.
## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Oracle/CustomPriceOracle/CustomPriceOracle.sol#L53-L59 
```solidity
    function updatePrice(uint256 _newPrice) external isTrusted {
        lastPrice = currentPrice;
        currentPrice = _newPrice;  //@audit no tolerance checks
        lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        emit PriceUpdated(address(this), currentPrice, lastUpdateTimestamp);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
