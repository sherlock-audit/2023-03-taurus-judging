# Not decreasing `currentMinted` in `TAU` in some cases

## Summary

In `TAU._decreaseCurrentMinted`, when `accountMinted < amount`, the `currentMinted` is not decreased.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TAU._decreaseCurrentMinted`:
```solidity
function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
    }
```

The `if` statement only decrease `currentMinted` when `accountMinted >= amount`. However, if `accountMinted < amount`(it's possible, since who burn the TAU can be different from who mint TAU to this account), the amount is not decreased.
## Impact


In some cases, this will make some vaults get unexpectedly more power to mint. Anyway, it's some unexpected behaviour, so I marked it as Medium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In fact, the `currentMinted` management in this `TAU` contract is somehow chaotic. The governance can give power to same vaults to mint TAU, but the power is not just as seen in the `mintLimit`, since the decrease management is sometimes not working as expected. Combining with abother issue that `msg.sender not identical with account`, I think this part's related features need to be reconsidered and refactored.
