# TAU doesn't decrease vault's mint amount when tokens are burned

## Summary
The TAU contract keeps track of the number of tokens that are minted to enforce a limit. But, when tokens are burned the value is not decreased.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever new TAU is minted, the amount is added to `currentMinted`. For every mint, the contract verifies that `currentMinted + amount < mintLimit`. When TAU is burned, it's supposed to reduce the caller's `currentMinted`. But, the contract compares the caller's `currentMinted` with the value of the account whose TAU is burned. Meaning, it compares the vault's value with that of the end user. 

```sol
    function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
    }
```

The end user is not granted the permission to mint any TAU themselves. Thus, their `currentMinted` will always be `0`. Meaning the check `accountMinted >= amount` is `0 >= X`, which will always evaluate to false (we never burn 0 tokens; if we do, that doesn't decrease `currentMinted` either).

## Impact
The vault's `currentMinted` is never decreased causing the vault to reach its limit which will stop users from taking out new loans.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `_decreaseCurrentMinted()` to:
```sol
    function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[msg.sender];
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
    }
```
