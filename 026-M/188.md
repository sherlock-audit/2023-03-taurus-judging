# updated price from trusted node is not guaranteed to be fresh

## Summary
When a trusted node calls the method `CustomPriceOracle#updatePrice` as a input is giving only the new price. The time stamp that represents the freshens of this data is not given as an input but is set as the moment when this method has been successfully called on chain.

## Impact
The freshness of the asset price is not guaranteed by the `CustomPriceOracle` and as a possible stale value can have bad implication for the protocol using this oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a trusted node updates an asset price as an input pass also the time the price was assessed to prevent using stale value price.

```diff
-function updatePrice(uint256 _newPrice) external isTrusted { 
+function updatePrice(uint256 _newPrice, uint256 updateTimestamp) external isTrusted { 
     lastPrice = currentPrice; 
     currentPrice = _newPrice; 
-    lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp; 
+    lastUpdateTimestamp = updateTimestamp; 
  
     emit PriceUpdated(address(this), currentPrice, lastUpdateTimestamp); 
 } 
```
