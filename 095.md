# Incorrect proportion configuration may cause distributeFees to fail

## Summary
Incorrect proportion configuration may cause distributeFees to fail
## Vulnerability Detail
In the FeeSplitter contract's `setFeeRecipients` function, the management is allowed to configure the `proportion` of each feeRecipient address. However, there is a requirement for the total sum of `proportions`, which must be equal to `Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION`.

```solidity
if (proportionTotal != Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION) {
    revert incorrectProportions(proportionTotal);
}
```
However, this restriction only limits the total sum, meaning it allows individual feeRecipient's `proportion` to be 0. But many tokens do not allow transfers of 0 amounts. This can cause the `distributeFees()` function to revert.

```solidity
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
  feeRecipient.recipient,
  (feeAmount * feeRecipient.proportion) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION //@audit
);
```


## Impact
