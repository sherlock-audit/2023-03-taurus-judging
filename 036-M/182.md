# GmxYieldAdapter#collectYield continues to function even on a paused vault

## Summary

In the readme it states: "Users can exit paused vaults, but otherwise no significant action should be possible on them." However, it is still possible to collect yield from GMX when the vault is paused. This is because GmxYieldAdapter#collectYield lacks the whenNotPaused modifier. 

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

Yield can still be collected even when the vault is paused, which is problematic depending on why the vault is paused
