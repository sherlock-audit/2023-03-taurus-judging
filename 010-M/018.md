# Users will lose rewards if position is closed using `emergencyClosePosition()`

## Summary
It is documented as such in `emergencyClosePosition()`,

> Note that since this function does not call updateReward, it should only be used when the contract is paused.

However, even if function is called when paused, user will still lose rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

`updateReward` is called when a position is modified or liquidated to reduce the debts of a user due to having earned some rewards from their yield-producing collateral position (currently fee + staked GLP).

Because closing position via `emergencyClosePosition()` does not update the new lower debt a user should have, they are essentially losing their rightful rewards. Note that since rewards are only updated on liquidation or modification of their position, it is very possible for users to lose considerable rewards if their position is closed via `emergencyClosePosition()` after some period of inactivity.

Furthermore, even if the function is called when protocol is paused, it does not protect user from this vulnerablity. `pause()` and `unpause()` does not `updateReward`.

## Impact
Users can lose considerable rewards if their position is closed using `emergencyClosePosition()`, with loss amount correlated with duration of inactivity.
