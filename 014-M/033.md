# BaseVault.sol: Users are unable to close loan when oracle is stale or disabled so they cannot withdraw their collateral

## Summary
When users try to withdraw their collateral this triggers a call to `_getCollPrice` which reverts if the oracle is stale or disabled.

This is a problem because users will not be able to withdraw their collateral in this case.
When a user has fully reduced his debt meaning `debt=0`, then he should be able to withdraw his collateral without the need for a valid price from the oracle.

Even the `emergencyClosePosition` function needs a valid price which should not be the case.

## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing collateral from a loan (either via the `BaseVault.modifyPosition` or `BaseVault.emergencyClosePosition` function) the `BaseVault._modifyPosition` function will be called.

When collateral is withdrawn, `mustCheckHealth` is set to true:

This means that `_checkAccountHealth` will be called:

Downstream this then calls `_getOraclePrice` which reverts if there is no valid price:

## Impact
Users are unable to withdraw their collateral when the oracle is stale or disabled even if they have no debt.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `BaseVault._modifyPosition` function, the `checkAccountHealth` function (which needs a valid price downstream) should only be called when `userDetails[_account].debt > 0`:
