# unchecked transfer LiquidationBot

## Summary
The contract LiquidationBot.sol has an unchecked transfer

## Vulnerability Detail

The return value of an external transfer/transferFrom call is not checked, not only the amount needs to becheck

## Impact

Several tokens do not revert in case of failure and return false. If one of these tokens is used in other contract, LiquidationBot will not revert if the transfer fails, and an attacker can call it for free
