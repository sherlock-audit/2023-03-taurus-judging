# The return value of transfer() in withdrawLiqRewards() function in LiquidationBot.sol and _removeLiquidity() in GlpManager.sol is not checked

## Summary
the return value of transfer in withdrawLiqRewards() function found in LiquidationBot.sol and _removeLiquidity() in GlpManager.sol is not checked 
transfer() should always have their return values checked because it is possible that the transfer could fail and the function would assume that the transfer was successful

## Vulnerability Detail
.transfer() is used to make transfers in these functions. 
Now .transfer() returns boolean but the return value of the transfer is not checked to ensure that the transfer was successful.

## Impact
Transfer could fail and rewards be lost due to unforeseen reasons, because the code will assume that the transfer was successful in a situation where the transfer fails.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this vulnerability, the return value of transfer should always be checked to ensure that the transfer was successful with a require statement like this
```solidity
require( collToken.transfer(msg.sender, _amount), "Transfer not sent");
```
before emitting the events and allowing the transfer to complete, to avoid loss of funds.
