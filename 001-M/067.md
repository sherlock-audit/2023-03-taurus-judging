# Unsafe ERC20 transfer/transferFrom can result in stuck funds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false.
tranfser/transferfrom is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked.
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.

## Impact
The issue is that the code doesn't use the safeTransfer() utility from SafeERC20.
Therefore, collToken that don't return a bool in transfer() will cause a revert which
means they are stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/LiquidationBot/LiquidationBot.sol#L111
```solidity
    function withdrawLiqRewards(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyMultisig {
        IERC20 collToken = IERC20(_token);
        if (_amount > collToken.balanceOf(address(this))) revert insufficientFunds();
        collToken.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);

``` 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
