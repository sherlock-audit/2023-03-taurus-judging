# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)). https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#no-revert-on-failure tranfser/transferfrom is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked. If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.
