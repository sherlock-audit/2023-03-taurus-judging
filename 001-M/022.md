# Use of transfer for arbitrary ERC20 tokens is not recommended

## Summary
Some tokens such as ZRX do not revert on failure. Instead, they return `false`, expecting integrating contracts from handling the fail state.

## Vulnerability Detail

`transfer` is used to transfer an arbitrary ERC20 tokens. If the token does not revert on failure, it is assumed to be successful. Liquidation reward withdrawal will silently fail but recognised as a successful withdrawal.

```solidity
function withdrawLiqRewards(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyMultisig {
	IERC20 collToken = IERC20(_token);
	if (_amount > collToken.balanceOf(address(this))) revert insufficientFunds();
	collToken.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);

	emit CollateralWithdrawn(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

## Impact
Withdrawal will silently fail but recognised as a successful withdrawal.

## Recommendation
Consider using OpenZeppelin's safeTranfer to do arbitrary ERC20 token transfer.
