# Users` collateral should be refunded when debt has been fully repaid

## Summary
Borrowers will not be entitled to TAU rewards when their debts equal `0`. So long as the accounts have not been forgotten, the collateral should be transferred back to the users the next time they modify the positions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is one possible scenario:

1. Bob had a position whose debt was about to be fully repaid.
2. He called `modifyPosition()` with `_debtDelta` that ended up greater than `currentDebt` because some portion of the debt was recovered by `updateRewards()`.
3. Bob fully repaid his debt but `_collateralDelta` had been entered as `0` thinking he might continue to reap his TAU rewards.

## Impact
Bob ended up contributing to the protocol yield at the expense of getting himself totally deprived of his supposed reward shares. Had he requested transfering the GLP tokens back to himself, he would have enjoyed 100% yield with a GMX LP position fully under his address. 

## Code Snippet
As can be seen from the code block below, the entire `if block` will be skipped if `_collateralDelta == 0`.

```solidity
        if (_collateralDelta != 0) {
            if (_increaseCollateral) {
                // Deposit collateral
                userDetails[_account].collateral += _collateralDelta;
                IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _collateralDelta);

                emit Deposit(_account, _collateralDelta);
            } else {
                // Withdraw collateral
                uint256 currentCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
                if (_collateralDelta > currentCollateral) revert insufficientCollateral();
                userDetails[_account].collateral = currentCollateral - _collateralDelta;
                mustCheckHealth = true;
                IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _collateralDelta);

                emit Withdraw(_account, _collateralDelta);
            }
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check after the `if block` above as follows:

```diff
+        uint256 _currentCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
+        if (userDetails[_account].debt == 0 && _currentCollateral != 0) {
+            userDetails[_account].collateral = 0;
+            IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _currentCollateral);
+        }

+        emit Withdraw(_account, _currentCollateral);
```
