# Extra yield accrued by user's collateral will not be returned to user after withdrawal

## Summary

Extra yield accrued by user's collateral will not be returned to user after withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

The yield earned from the yield bearing collateral is split into two - 80% is used to pay the loans taken out by the user and 20% is used to pay the protocol. In the case where there is no debt / excess debt, the 80% is stored in a variable `tauWithheld`. However, if the user decides to put in collateral and not take any debt, or drew out a loan and paid the loan in full, if the user wants to withdraw the collateral back, the yield is not withdrawn as well and will be stuck in the contract.

```solidity
            } else {
                // Withdraw collateral
                uint256 currentCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
                if (_collateralDelta > currentCollateral) revert insufficientCollateral();
                userDetails[_account].collateral = currentCollateral - _collateralDelta;
                mustCheckHealth = true;
                IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _collateralDelta);


                emit Withdraw(_account, _collateralDelta);
            }
```

## Impact

Yield will be stuck in the contract if there is no debt and collateral is withdrawn fully.

## Recommendation

Recommend giving the 80% of yield back to the user, as TAU stablecoins or swapping the stablecoin back to the collateral and refunding the user. Could also have a mapping for how much TAU is withheld by every user, so that the user can withdraw the excess yield after withdrawing his collateral.
