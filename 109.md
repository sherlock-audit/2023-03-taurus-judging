# emergencyClosePosition() can be called even when the contract is not paused

## Summary
The natspec for this functions mentions:
>  * Note that since this function does not call updateReward, it should only be used when the contract is paused.

However there is no check to implement the same .

## Vulnerability Detail
The natspec mentions that this function should only be used when the contract is paused, however the function does not check this. Hence a user can close their position even when contract is not paused. 

## Impact
A user can call this function even when contract is not paused, thus bypassing the function logic/flow.

`Note that since this function does not call updateReward, it should only be used when the contract is paused.`

```solidity
    function emergencyClosePosition() external {
        _modifyPosition(msg.sender, userDetails[msg.sender].collateral, userDetails[msg.sender].debt, false, false);
    }
```
