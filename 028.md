# BaseVault.sol: Users should be able to partially back back loan when paused

## Summary
Currently the only function that allows users to interact with a loan when in the `paused` state is the `BaseVault.emergencyClosePosition` function:
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L227-L229)
```solidity
    function emergencyClosePosition() external {
        _modifyPosition(msg.sender, userDetails[msg.sender].collateral, userDetails[msg.sender].debt, false, false);
    }
```

The issue is that this function only allows full repayment of debt.

A user should be able to partially pay back a loan in the paused state by burning `TAU`.

Note that other actions cannot be allowed in the `paused` state:
* Increasing collateral cannot be allowed due to possible sandwich attacks with the reward (reward payout is halted when `paused` so a user can get an unfair share when he increases his collateral in the `paused` state
* Increase debt and decrease collateral cannot be allowed due to a necessary health check 

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say the Vault is `paused` and a user has debt. He can only fully close the loan.
So if he will get liquidated when the Vault is unpaused and the user does not have enough funds to fully close the loan, he can do nothing to protect himself against liquidation.
Sure he may wait until the Vault is unpaused but then he may already have gotten liquidated so this is not an option.

## Impact
A user may not be able to fully close his loan.
But then he cannot protect himself against liquidation.
So unfair liquidations occur leading to loss for users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a new function that can be called when `paused` that allows a user to burn `TAU` and thereby reduce his debt.

E.g. like this:
```solidity
function reduceDebt(uint256 _amount) external {
        _modifyPosition(msg.sender, 0, _amount, false, false);
    }
```
