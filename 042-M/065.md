# BaseVault: Debt is not set to 0 when collateral is fully liquidated so user cannot take out new loan or else he loses money

## Summary
It is a property of the protocol that after liquidation some debt might not have been paid back (-> bad debt).
The protocol handles this by burning TAU without paying out any rewards. 
In effect this cancels out the bad debt.

The issue is that when a user's account is liquidated and bad debt persists, the user's debt is not reset to 0.
The debt of a user should be set to 0 when all collateral is liquidated.

The current behavior limits the availability of the protocol for affected users and can easily lead to users effectively losing money if they take out a new loan after being liquidated.

The protocol should keep track of the bad debt that is eliminated by setting a user's debt to zero such that it can be repaid by the protocol. E.g. a variable can be introduced that adds the bad debt when a user's debt is set to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BaseVault.liquidate` function the user info is updated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L371-L373
Quoting from the contest page:
> In a situation where an account's debt is worth close to or more than the value of its collateral, liquidators should still be able to liquidate the account's debt at a discount.

So it is possible for a liquidator to receive all collateral without having to pay back all the debt.

This means that `userDetails[_account].collateral = 0` and `userDetails[_account].debt > 0`.

So when a user wants to take out a new loan he still has the debt left even though he has been fully liquidated.

## Impact
This means that either the user recognizes this and will not be able to take out a new loan or if he takes out a new loan he will be worse off and lose money.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I propose that if after liquidation the collateral left is so small that it cannot be profitably liquidated anymore, the debt of a user should be set to zero.

Note: This fix only sets the debt to zero. The sponsor should assess how to best keep track of bad debt by e.g. introducing a variable that keeps track of bad debt. This variable can be incremented in the "if" case.
