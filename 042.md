# GLPPriceOracle might run out of gas

## Summary

The GLPPriceOracle may run out of gas when querying the GLP price on the manager.

## Vulnerability Detail

The GLPPriceOracle calls `getPrice()` on the GLPManager, which goes through every vault of GMX to calculate their value by querying one / two oracles depending on parameters and return the total value divided by the supply of GLP.

The GLPManager calls the GMX vault, which calls the GMX VaultPriceFeed, which will get primary price from ChainLink's oracles as well as a secondary price from a custom GMX oracle, and a price from an AMM if the parameters `_includeAmmPrice && isAmmEnabled` are set to true.

In the current state, there are 9 whitelisted tokens to compute the price for and `_includeAmmPrice` is set to false. The `getPrice()` function already costs about 1.5m gas to execute and its cost could increase proportional to the number of tokens handled by GMX or could be multiplied if the `_includeAmmPrice` parameter is set to true.

## Impact

From reading the code and documentation of GMX, I understand that `GlpManager.getPrice()` function is not supposed to be executed on-chain and serves the UI to call off-chain. We can foresee that this function's gas cost may go above the gas limit the protocol is willing to use / Arbitrum's sequencer is willing to accept.

## Code Snippet

GMX's GlpManager getPrice function:

Calls getMinPrice or getMaxPrice on vault:

Reaches the getPrice function of the VaultPriceFeed:

## Tool used

Manual Review / calling contracts to estimate gas

## Recommendation

Use different oracle system / custom oracle.
