# Incorrect startTimestamp recorded when updateReward(address _account) is called

## Summary
According to the code, the `startTimestamp` variable in the `UserDetails` struct should record the "Time when the first deposit was made by the user":
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L41-L46)
```solidity
    struct UserDetails {
        uint256 collateral; // Collateral amount deposited by user
        uint256 debt; // Debt amount borrowed by user
        uint256 lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral; // Last updated reward per collateral for the user
        uint256 startTimestamp; // Time when the first deposit was made by the user
    }
```

The [`updateReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L78-L118) modifier of the `BaseVault` contract records the start time of a user when it is called, instead of when the user's first deposit is made. This can lead to incorrect timestamps being stored for users, which could cause issues for anyone integrating the protocol expecting first deposit timestamps.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `updateReward` modifier of the `Vault` contract can just be called by everyone by calling [`BaseVault.updateRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L452) for any user. The `startTimestamp` for a user is recorded when the modifier is called, instead of when the user's first deposit is made.

```solidity
if (_userCollateral > 0) {
   ...
} else {
    // If this is a new user, add them to the userAddresses array to keep track of them.
    if (userDetails[_account].startTimestamp == 0) {
        userAddresses.push(_account);
        userDetails[_account].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    }
}

```


This can lead to misleading timestamps being recorded for users.

For example, if a user deposits collateral at time `t1`, and the `updateReward` modifier has been called before at time `t0` (for example another user might have called the `updateRewards` function), the timestamp stored in the `UserDetails` struct will be `t0` instead of `t1`. This could lead to issues when protocols integrate with the `BaseVault` contract, as they may expect the timestamp to reflect the moment of the user's first deposit.

## Impact
The incorrect time stored in the `UserDetails` struct can lead to inconsistencies when anyone integrates the protocol. Based on documentation everyone will expect the `startTimestamp` to accurately reflect the moment the user's first deposit was made, and this expectation will not be met if the `startTimestamp` is recorded when the `updateReward` modifier is called.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `updateRewards` modifier should only initialize the `startTimestamp` when the collateral of a user has changed to a non-zero value for the first time.
