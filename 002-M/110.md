# All users cannot liquidate funds

## Summary
The natspec for liquidate() function mentions:

> This function can be invoked by any one to liquidate the account and returns true if succeeds, false otherwise

However, the `onlyKeeper` modifier is implemented on the function, preventing any user who is not a keeper from calling the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the natspec for `liquidate()` function, any user should be able to liquidate their account. However, this is not possible due to the `onlyKeeper` modifier implemented on the function.

## Impact
All users cannot liquidate funds, which is contradictory to what is mentioned in the natspec. Users who are not keepers are unable to liquidate their funds

`/// @dev This function can be invoked by any one to liquidate the account and returns true if succeeds, false otherwise`

```solidity
function liquidate(LiqParams memory _liqParams) external onlyKeeper returns (bool) {
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `onlyKeeper` modifier so that the function performs as per the natspec.
