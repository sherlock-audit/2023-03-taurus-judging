# updating price for mismatched underlying asset is not prevented in `CustomPriceOracle` contract

## Summary
The `CustomPriceOracle` is deployed to be used as an price oracle for the `asset` that is passed in the constructor. But when the price is updated by a trusted node this address and also decimals that represent the given price is not verified to be correct for the initially specified asset. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `CustomPriceOracle` contract is created its constructor gets the information which underlying asset and number of decimal will this oracle represent

But when trusted nodes updates a new price there is no verification if the passed values are for the correct asset and also decimals.

## Impact

If a trusted node is trusted for more then one asset there is no prevention by checking if the right asset is passed for the right oracle address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a trusted node tries to update to a new price require it is for the right asset and decimals so there is no possibility of erroneous updates

```diff
-function updatePrice(uint256 _newPrice) external isTrusted {
+function updatePrice(uint256 _newPrice, address _asset, uint8 _decimals) external isTrusted {
+    require(asset == _asset && decimals == _decimals, "Wrong oracle for asset");
+
    lastPrice = currentPrice;
    currentPrice = _newPrice;
    lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;


    emit PriceUpdated(address(this), currentPrice, lastUpdateTimestamp);
}
```
