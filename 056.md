# Potential Reentrancy attack due to State changes in Modifiers + No Guard

## Summary

Solidity functions should always use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern which states that the initial stage will contain only checks and validations which resides in the modifiers.
Due to this reason, modifiers should only implement checks and validations inside of it and should not make state changes and external calls.
BaseVault.sol was found to be violating this pattern and the modifier updateReward was making sensitive state changes and modifications.

## Vulnerability Detail


The potential vulnerability of updating states inside a modifier is that it allows an attacker to call a function multiple times and execute the state-changing code repeatedly. (i.e reentrancy)

In the example below the function _disburseTau() and _withholdTau() are functions that can modify the state of the contract. If an attacker calls a function that uses this modifier and then calls it again before the state-changing code is complete, the attacker could potentially change the behavior of the contract in unexpected ways.

If liquidate or any other function  (such as `_modifyPosition`) that the modifier is applied, is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, then the updateReward modifier could also become vulnerable.


For example, if an attacker calls the liquidate() function multiple times before the state-changing code in the updateReward() modifier is complete, they could potentially manipulate the collateral and debt values of the user being liquidated, which could lead to incorrect amounts of TAU being burned or transferred to the liquidator.

This is the modifier being observed.

```solidity
    modifier updateReward(address _account) {
        // Disburse available yield from the drip feed
        _disburseTau();

        // If user has collateral, pay down their debt and recycle surplus rewards back into the tauDripFeed.
        uint256 _userCollateral = userDetails[_account].collateral;
        if (_userCollateral > 0) {
            // Get diff between global rewardPerCollateral and user lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
            uint256 _rewardDiff = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral -
                userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral;

            // Calculate user's TAU earned since the last update, use it to pay off debt
            uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION;

            if (_tauEarned > 0) {
                uint256 _userDebt = userDetails[_account].debt;
                if (_tauEarned > _userDebt) {
                    // If user has earned more than enough TAU to pay off their debt, pay off debt and add surplus to drip feed
                    userDetails[_account].debt = 0;

                    _withholdTau(_tauEarned - _userDebt);
                    _tauEarned = _userDebt;
                } else {
                    // Pay off as much debt as possible
                    userDetails[_account].debt = _userDebt - _tauEarned;
                }

                emit TauEarned(_account, _tauEarned);
            }
        } else {
            // If this is a new user, add them to the userAddresses array to keep track of them.
            if (userDetails[_account].startTimestamp == 0) {
                userAddresses.push(_account);
                userDetails[_account].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            }
        }

        // Update user lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
        userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral;
        _;
    }

```

This modifier is used in the external call `liquidate()`

```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address _account,
        uint256 _debtAmount,
        uint256 _minExchangeRate
    ) external onlyLiquidator whenNotPaused updateReward(_account) returns (bool) {
        if (_debtAmount == 0) revert wrongLiquidationAmount();

        UserDetails memory accDetails = userDetails[_account];

        // Since Taurus accounts' debt continuously decreases, liquidators may pass in an arbitrarily large number in order to
        // request to liquidate the entire account.
        if (_debtAmount > accDetails.debt) {
            _debtAmount = accDetails.debt;
        }

        // Get total fee charged to the user for this liquidation. Collateral equal to (liquidated taurus debt value * feeMultiplier) will be deducted from the user's account.
        // This call reverts if the account is healthy or if the liquidation amount is too large.
        (uint256 collateralToLiquidate, uint256 liquidationSurcharge) = _calcLiquidation(
            accDetails.collateral,
            accDetails.debt,
            _debtAmount
        );

        // Check that collateral received is sufficient for liquidator
        uint256 collateralToLiquidator = collateralToLiquidate - liquidationSurcharge;
        if (collateralToLiquidator < (_debtAmount * _minExchangeRate) / Constants.PRECISION) {
            revert insufficientCollateralLiquidated(_debtAmount, collateralToLiquidator);
        }

        // Update user info
        userDetails[_account].collateral = accDetails.collateral - collateralToLiquidate;
        userDetails[_account].debt = accDetails.debt - _debtAmount;

        // Burn liquidator's Tau
        TAU(tau).burnFrom(msg.sender, _debtAmount);

        // Transfer part of _debtAmount to liquidator and Taurus as fees for liquidation
        IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralToLiquidator);
        IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(
            Controller(controller).addressMapper(Constants.FEE_SPLITTER),
            liquidationSurcharge
        );

        emit AccountLiquidated(msg.sender, _account, collateralToLiquidate, liquidationSurcharge);

        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent reentrancy attacks, it is recommended to use a pattern such as the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves performing all checks and calculations before making any state-changing interactions, and ensuring that state changes occur at the end of the function. Additionally, using the nonReentrant modifier provided by the OpenZeppelin library can help prevent reentrancy attacks by ensuring that a function cannot be called again until the state-changing code is complete.

updateReward() should be converted to a function that is called before transfers inside of `liquidate()` are called. 


```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address _account,
        uint256 _debtAmount,
        uint256 _minExchangeRate
    ) external onlyLiquidator whenNotPaused updateReward(_account) returns (bool) {
        if (_debtAmount == 0) revert wrongLiquidationAmount();

        UserDetails memory accDetails = userDetails[_account];

        // Since Taurus accounts' debt continuously decreases, liquidators may pass in an arbitrarily large number in order to
        // request to liquidate the entire account.
        if (_debtAmount > accDetails.debt) {
            _debtAmount = accDetails.debt;
        }

        // Get total fee charged to the user for this liquidation. Collateral equal to (liquidated taurus debt value * feeMultiplier) will be deducted from the user's account.
        // This call reverts if the account is healthy or if the liquidation amount is too large.
        (uint256 collateralToLiquidate, uint256 liquidationSurcharge) = _calcLiquidation(
            accDetails.collateral,
            accDetails.debt,
            _debtAmount
        );

        // Check that collateral received is sufficient for liquidator
        uint256 collateralToLiquidator = collateralToLiquidate - liquidationSurcharge;
        if (collateralToLiquidator < (_debtAmount * _minExchangeRate) / Constants.PRECISION) {
            revert insufficientCollateralLiquidated(_debtAmount, collateralToLiquidator);
        }

        // Update user info
        userDetails[_account].collateral = accDetails.collateral - collateralToLiquidate;
        userDetails[_account].debt = accDetails.debt - _debtAmount;


          // Update rewards for the user 
          updateReward(_account)

        // Burn liquidator's Tau
        TAU(tau).burnFrom(msg.sender, _debtAmount);

        // Transfer part of _debtAmount to liquidator and Taurus as fees for liquidation
        IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralToLiquidator);
        IERC20(collateralToken).safeTransfer(
            Controller(controller).addressMapper(Constants.FEE_SPLITTER),
            liquidationSurcharge
        );

        emit AccountLiquidated(msg.sender, _account, collateralToLiquidate, liquidationSurcharge);

        return true;
    }
```

This way, an attacker will not be able to manipulate state variables through modifiers.
