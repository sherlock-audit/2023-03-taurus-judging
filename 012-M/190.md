# Logic error in getUsers() function

## Summary
The functions getUsers() and getUserDetailsinRange() are meant to retrieve user information for a set of indexes. The comment says it returns info of both start and end index inclusive, but this is incorrect. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The end index is not included in the returned data even though the initialized array has a place for it. Also, the check at Line 174 fails for an edge case when _end = getUsersCount() because the latter is array length which is a counter but _end is the index position of array member and it starts from 0. The check at L#174 should have been _end >= getUsersCount() and the loop at L#178 should have been i<= _end  

## Impact
Since the array has been initialized at L#176 for the correct number of items, the last member will always be zero value. This intensifies in getUserDetailsinRange function because it returns an empty struct for the last member.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Anyone who retrieves this information will think data is inclusive of end index because the comment says so. However, the impact can be high if that user uses this information in some other place as a function parameter. This may cause sending of funds to the zero address or pushing of zero address into userAddresses list via modifyPositions function.
