# Off by one error in getUsers

## Summary

The functions `getUsers` and `getUsersDetailsInRange` initialize an array to return the users or their details in a range of index, but the array is one too big and will end with the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail

These functions revert if `_end > getUsersCount()`, from which we can assume `_end` can reach the number of users. The returned array should thus be sized by `_end - _start` and not `_end - _start + 1`.

I.e. if `_start = 0` and `_end = numUsers`, it should have a size of `_end`.

## Impact

Depending on how these return values are used, this could result in failing transactions. 

As an example, the LiquidationBot fetches the users in `fetchUnhealthyAccounts`. The zero address will be deemed unhealthy and returned by this function. Depending on how the liquidation is triggered, the bot (or keeper) may perpetually try to liquidate the zero address.
