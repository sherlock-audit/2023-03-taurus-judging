# The currentMinted of vault will not decrease when the user repays TAU

## Summary

When a user borrows TAU from a vault, the `currentMinted[vault]` will be accumulated and cannot exceed the `mintLimit[vault]`, otherwise the user's borrowing fails. When user repays TAU to vault, `currentMined[vault]` does not decrease. If users borrow and repay frequently or the malicious user borrows and repays all the time, the value of `currentMinted[vault]` will soon be close to the value of `mintLimit[vault]`. Finally, it can only be recovered by manually updating `mintLimit[vault]`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The reason for this issue is that vault calls `TAU.burnFrom` when processing user repayment, which did not reduce the value of currentMinted [vault]. Let's look at the [[code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L71-L84)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/TAU.sol#L71-L84):

```solidity
//
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual override {
        super.burnFrom(account, amount);
        _decreaseCurrentMinted(account, amount);
    }

    function _decreaseCurrentMinted(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        // If the burner is a vault, subtract burnt TAU from its currentMinted.
        // This has a few highly unimportant edge cases which can generally be rectified by increasing the relevant vault's mintLimit.
        uint256 accountMinted = currentMinted[account];	//account=user, so currentMinted[account] always equal to 0.
        if (accountMinted >= amount) {	//never into if statement
            currentMinted[msg.sender] = accountMinted - amount;
        }
    }
```

`BurnFrom` internally calls `_DecreaseCurrentMinted` that the account parameter equal to user's address, so `currentMinted[account]` is always 0, and **if statement's condition** (`0>=amount`) will never be satisfied.

## Impact

This issue will cause users to fail to borrow TAU from vault. The core function of the system fails.
