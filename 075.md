# Attacker can manipulate disburse rate

## Summary
`TauDripFeed.disburseTau` function only disburses a fraction of remaining tau in `tauwithheld`.
If an attacker calls `disburseTau()` multiple times (>10) a day, the disburse rate will decrease so much that around 36 percent of Tau will remain undisbursed at the end of the day. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider an active vault that has transactions and disburses every second 
(or an attacker calls `disburseTau()`function every second)

Every second the `tokensToDisburse` is a fraction (**`x`**) of tauwithheld :
`_tokensToDisburse = (_timeElapsed * tauWithheld) / DRIP_DURATION `
`x = 1second / 1day = 1/24*3600 = 0.000011574 `


1. t=0s :   tauwithheld = **A**. _Suppose that the A does not increase during these actions (best scenario)._
2. t=1s :   tauwithheld = A*(1-x) = 0.999988426*A
3. t=2s :   tauwithheld = A(1-x)^2 = 0.999976852*A
4. ....
6. t=10000s :  tauwithheld = 0.988492582*A
7. t= 86400s (1day) : tauwithheld = 0.367877312*A

We see that after one day (86400 disburses), 37 percent of tauwithheld is still remaining.
Considering that the tau is accumulating in time, we can guess that after a time the tauwithheld will grow considerably.

### Other cases:
If we apply the same calculations to other vaults with varying levels of activity:
- y is the tauwithheld at the end of the day
- x is the number of disburses in a day
- **y = (1 -  1/x)^(x)**

On the [chart](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=Power%5B%5C%2840%291+-++Divide%5B1%2Cx%5D%5C%2841%29%2C%5C%2840%29x%5C%2841%29%5D) we can see that:

1. As disburses per day (**x**) increase, tauWithheld remaining at the end of the day (**y**) increases as well.
2. The remaining tauwithheld only gets close to zero when the vault has near 1 disburse in a day. 
3. **There will be a 0.36 of tauwithheld remaining at the end of each day if the vault has more than 10 disbursements a day**

## Impact

1. Dripping mechanism does not fully protect against sandwich attacks.
2. Attacker can decrease dripping rate to accumulate the tau and then increase it to get the rewards by depositing large amount of collateral (sandwich attack).
3. Also in active vaults, users will not get a portion of their tau rewards because it is locked in a dripping mechanism.
4. According to [doc](https://docs.taurus.loans/taurus/mechanics), **dripDuration is the time over which deposited yield is distributed to the vault**. This is not implemented correctly and dripDuration can be higher for active vaults.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
disbursements should be linear, which means a fraction of a **fixed amount**
one idea is to keep the tauwithheld amount at the beginning of the day (tauwithheldFix) and set it again for the next day.
```solidity
    _tokensToDisburse = (_timeElapsed * tauWithheldFix) / DRIP_DURATION;     
```
We want to ensure that 100% of tauwithheldFix is disbursed by the end of the day, while gathering tau is disbursed the next day.
