# FeeSplitter#distributeFees is unable to distribute fees that are paid in native ETH

## Summary

Fee splitter may receive native ETH as fees from some future vaults but will unable to distribute them to fee recipients.

## Vulnerability Detail

[FeeSplitter.sol#L28-L40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Tokenomics/FeeSplitter.sol#L28-L40)

    function distributeFees(address _token) external {
        uint256 feeAmount = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (feeAmount == 0) return;


        uint256 _numFeeRecipients = numFeeRecipients;
        for (uint256 i; i < _numFeeRecipients; ++i) {
            FeeRecipient memory feeRecipient = feeRecipients[i];
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
                feeRecipient.recipient,
                (feeAmount * feeRecipient.proportion) / Constants.PERCENT_PRECISION
            );
        }
    }

FeeSplitter#distributeFees only distributes ERC20 tokens and are unable to distribute native ETH. The result is that if the contract receives any ETH it won't be able to distribute it and it will be permanently lost.

## Impact

Native ETH received by FeeSplitter will be lost permanently
