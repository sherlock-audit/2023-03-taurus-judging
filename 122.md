# Later borrowers gain an advantage in loan repayment compared to earlier borrowers

## Summary

Later borrowers gain an advantage in loan repayment compared to earlier borrowers

## Vulnerability Detail

When an earlier borrower's loan is repayed and there is a surplus, the surplus is added back to the drip feed.

```solidity
 if (_tauEarned > _userDebt) {
                    // If user has earned more than enough TAU to pay off their debt, pay off debt and add surplus to drip feed
                    userDetails[_account].debt = 0;

                    _withholdTau(_tauEarned - _userDebt);
                    _tauEarned = _userDebt;
```

This surplus will then be used to repay loans of later borrowers. 

This gives an unfair advantage to later borrowers and disincentivizes early borrowing.

## Impact

Borrowers are likely to wait until when the loans of earlier borrowers start getting fully repaid before joining and gaining an advantage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution would be to track the surplus from full repayment as a unique value that can specifically be used to aid the protocol when there are bad debts rather than using the surplus to repay ongoing healthy loans.
