# User lose rewards when debt fully repaid

## Summary

Once a user's debt is fully repaid via yield reward swapped for TAU, the user will not receive anything for the yield they provide to the protocol via their collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users update their positions or when `updateReward` is directly called via `updateRewards`, the TAU reward is calculated for the user. If this tau reward is bigger than the user debt, its debt is lowered to 0, the amount not used to lower the debt is sent back to `_withholdTau()`, and the `userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral` value is updated so that the user is no longer eligible to the same reward.

This means that user leaving collateral in a position with no debt (or a debt lower than the pending reward) provide yield to repay for the debt of other users instead of earning reward.

## Impact

Users not monitoring their position carefully enough and increasing their debt / withdrawing their collateral lose reward.
This disincentivize participation in the protocol for lazy users.

## Code Snippet

BaseVault `updateReward` sends back the earned TAU reward to TauDripFeed when debt reaches 0:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Store the earned reward that does not cover debt in a new storage variable for the user and let the user withdraw this as TAU token instead of sending the reward back to TauDripFeed.
