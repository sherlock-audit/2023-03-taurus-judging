# Impractical dripDuration when the user base has grown drastically

## Summary
The implementation of `dripDuration` could prove to be a hurdle both in terms of tremendous amount of cumulative gas waste and precision loss to `_extraRewardPerCollateral` particularly when the system has had its user base grow to a very huge size.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the scenario:

Supposing 1 day has elapsed when `swapForTau()` of SwapHandler.sol added TAU rewards to `tauWithheld` via `_disburseTau()` and `_withholdTau()`. 

1. Bob realised his debt has been almost paid up, and decided to mint more TAU by calling `modifyPosition()` that would have the modifier `updateReward()` run first.
2. Bob has earned more than enough TAU to pay off his debt, and the surplus was added to drip feed via `_withholdTau()`.
3. The surplus entailed was less than 1 token, and `swapForTau(()` would not be called till another day has passed.
4. From now onwards till the contract was paused, the following `if clause` was going to be skipped always since `tokensLastDisbursedTimestamp` was going to be updated each time `modifyPosition()` or `liquidate()` was called. And, it was unlikely `_disburseTau()` would not be invoked for more than 24 hours.

```solidity
                if (_timeElapsed >= DRIP_DURATION) {
                    _tokensToDisburse = tauWithheld;
                    tauWithheld = 0;
                } else {
                    _tokensToDisburse = (_timeElapsed * tauWithheld) / DRIP_DURATION;
                    tauWithheld -= _tokensToDisburse;
                }
```
5. In the next 24 hours, `_extraRewardPerCollateral` could involve a series of precision losses while adding dust amounts to `cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral`  if `_currentCollateral` (in a different vault) was a very big number due to a very low market price associated.

## Impact
If the user base has grown to a level where `_disburseTau()` was invoked every second, the amount of gas incurred would be approximately 20_000 * 86400 ~ 1.73 billion gas per day.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing `DRIP_DURATION` and simply update `_tokensToDisburse` with `tauWithheld` whenever `tauWithheld` is greater than `0`.
