# BaseVault._modifyPosition calculated collateral for fee-on-transfer token incorrectly

## Summary
Some tokens take a transfer fee (STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (USDT, USDC).
In such case, __BaseVault._modifyPosition_ doesn't handle the amount correctly
