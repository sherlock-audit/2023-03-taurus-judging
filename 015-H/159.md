# The decimals of collateral may different from 1e18, causing the user to borrow more than the real amount that can be borrowed.

## Summary

The decimals of collateral may different from 1e18, causing the user to borrow more than the real amount that can be borrowed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The decimals of Collateral are not always 1e18. If we have a collateral token with 1e27 decimals, we will get a wrong collateral ratio.

Suppose we have 120 collateral tokens which are worth $120.

In `_computeCR()`: `(_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals)`
* `_coll`: 120 * 1e27
* `_price`: 1 * 1e18, which means a collateral worth $1
* `priceDecimals`: 1e18
* `_debt`: 100 * 1e18, the max debt due to 120% collateral ratio

We get: `(120*1e27 * 1*1e18 * 1e18) / (100*1e18 * 10**18) = 1.2 * 1e27`, which is 120000000000% rather than 120%.

## Impact

Users can borrow more than the real amount that can be borrowed.
