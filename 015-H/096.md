# Use of hard coded decimals of 18 for collateral token

## Summary
The protocol assumes the decimal of the collateral token is unanimously 18 as the decimal of `TAU`. This could lead to arithmetic issue if the decimal of a non-GLP token  is non-18 and it is used as a yield-bearing collateral for a different vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a typical scenario:

The decimal of the newly selected collateral token is 8.

The code line in _computeCR() associated with calculating `newCollRatio`:

[File: TauMath.sol#L18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Libs/TauMath.sol#L18)

```solidity
            uint256 newCollRatio = (_coll * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (_debt * 10 ** priceDecimals);
```
`10 ** priceDecimals` in the denominator serves to ensure `_price` is 1e18 scaled. Currently, the decimal of `GLP` token is 18. So this is not going to be an issue. However, in this scenario, the decimal of the collateral for a new vault entailed is 8, and it is going to make `newCollRatio` 10 ** (18 - 10), i.e. 1e8 scaled instead of the intended 1e18.
 
(Note: In an opposite scenario, if the decimal of the collateral token entailed were more than 18, `newCollRatio` would end up over scaled.)

## Impact
Consequently, this makes the `accountHealth` tremendously go underwater and set [`diff == MAX_LIQ_DISCOUNT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L439-L442) by default  when `liquidate()` is called.

(Note: In the opposite scenario, this would make users' `accountHealth` super good and never liquidable since [`_calcLiquidationDiscount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L433) would readily revert for the unhealthy accounts. 

Additionally, the erroneous logic is going to directly affect the view functions dependent on `_computeCR()`, i.e. [`getMaxLiquidation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L137) and [`_getCollRatio()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L195).

And apparently, `_getMaxLiquidation()` involving a ratio that has `collateral` appear as the subtrahend of the numerator will also be likewise affected.

[File: BaseVault.sol#L251-L253](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L251-L253)

```solidity
        maxRepay =
            ((MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO * _debt) - ((_collateral * _price * Constants.PRECISION) / (10 ** _decimals))) /
            (MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO - _liquidationDiscount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider having the collateral token amount 18 decimals scaled whenever it is included in a ratio or a division. 

Here is a useful pure function that may be implemented in BaseVault.sol along with some needed additions since no state variables are allowed in the library, TauMath.sol:

```solidity
  function scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
    uint256 _underlyingAmt,
    uint256 _underlyingTokenDecimals
  ) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return
      (_underlyingAmt * 1e18) /
      10**(_underlyingTokenDecimals);
  }
```
```diff
+    address public collateralToken;

    function __BaseVault_init(address _controller, address _tau, address _collateralToken) internal initializer {
        __Controllable_init(_controller);
        __TauDripFeed_init(_tau, _collateralToken);
+        collateralToken = _collateralToken;
    }
```
For instance, [`getMaxLiquidation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/Vault/BaseVault.sol#L137) invoking `computeCR()` may be refactored as follows:

```diff
-        uint256 _collRatio = TauMath._computeCR(accDetails.collateral, accDetails.debt, price, decimals);
+        uint256 _collRatio = TauMath._computeCR(scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(accDetails.collateral, IERC20(collateralToken).decimal()), accDetails.debt, price, decimals);
```
