# Rewards are updated wrongly if collateral is not 18 decimals

## Summary
The calculation of `tauEarned` in `updateReward` is incorrect when collateral used is not 18 decimals. This can critically break the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is how `_tauEarned` is calculated in `updateReward`

```solidity
uint256 _rewardDiff = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral - userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION
```

`_rewardDiff` is calculated based on the cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral. Since TAU is 18 decimals, `_rewardDiff` is 18 decimals. `Constants.PRECISION` is 18 decimals as well, and hence the resulting computation of `_tauEarned` will be based on the number of decimals of `_userCollateral`.

However, correct decimals for `_tauEarned` should be 18 as TAU token is 18 decimals. Subsequent computations based on either an inflated or deflated value of `_tauEarned` will break the protocol.

## Impact
Protocol cannot function correctly if collateral used is not 18 decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider dividing by number of decimals of collateral instead of `Constants.PRECISION`

```diff
- uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION
+ uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / 10 ** decimals()
```
