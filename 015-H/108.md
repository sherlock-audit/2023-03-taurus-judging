# Protocol does not handle tokens that don't use 18 decimals

## Summary

Protocol does not handle tokens that don't use 18 decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

Multiple functions in the protocol don't account for collateral tokens that don't have 18 decimals. As per the the specification, the protocol is intended to handle any non rebasing ERC20 token. 

Functions including `updateReward`  and `liquidate` make calculations with the assumption that the collateral token has 18 decimals.

```solidity
        uint256 collateralToLiquidator = collateralToLiquidate - liquidationSurcharge;
        if (collateralToLiquidator < (_debtAmount * _minExchangeRate) / Constants.PRECISION) {
            revert insufficientCollateralLiquidated(_debtAmount, collateralToLiquidator);
        }
```

```solidity
            // Get diff between global rewardPerCollateral and user lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral
            uint256 _rewardDiff = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral -
                userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral;

            // Calculate user's TAU earned since the last update, use it to pay off debt
            uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION;
```

If the collateral token doesn't have 18 decimals, they will not be scaled as the decimals they use isn't take into account.

## Impact

Wrong calculation of various important values with effects ranging from improper accounting to loss of funds.

## Recommendation

Check the decimals collateral tokens are using and scale them to the precision of the protocol.
