# The last user address of `getUsers()` is omitted

## Summary
In LiquidationBot.sol, `fetchUnhealthyAccounts(_)` makes an external call to `vault.getUsers()` amidst its function logic to output a list of unhealthy accounts that is filtered from [`_startIndex`, `_startIndex + offset`]  inclusive. However, `getUsers()` has a logic flaw that is only returning all requested user addresses except the last one, apparently entailing an issue that is beyond a simple code and comment mismatch.

## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen from the code block below, the array size of `users` is clearly declared as start and end index inclusive, i.e. `_end - _start + 1`. However, the `for` loop that ensues does not have the last element included because of the inappropriate use of `<` in the iterative conditions.

```solidity
    /** @dev Get the user addresses in the range given start and end index
     * note the start and end index are inclusive
     */
    function getUsers(uint256 _start, uint256 _end) public view returns (address[] memory users) {
        if (_end > getUsersCount() || _start > _end) revert indexOutOfBound();

        users = new address[](_end - _start + 1);

        for (uint256 i = _start; i < _end; ++i) {
            users[i - _start] = userAddresses[i];
        }
    }
```
## Impact
Consequently, the front-end bot making a read call to `fetchUnhealthyAccounts()` is going to receive an output return that may have one unhealthy account short if the omitted element from `getUsers()` happens to be an unhealthy one.

The impact is inversely proportional to the amount of requested user addresses, and could be associated with a miss out probability rate as high as 0.5 (50%) if the request entailed was as little as 2 elements.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider refactoring the affected `getUsers()` as follows:

```diff
    function getUsers(uint256 _start, uint256 _end) public view returns (address[] memory users) {
        if (_end > getUsersCount() || _start > _end) revert indexOutOfBound();


        users = new address[](_end - _start + 1);

-        for (uint256 i = _start; i < _end; ++i) {
+        for (uint256 i = _start; i <= _end; ++i) {
            users[i - _start] = userAddresses[i];
        }
    }
```
