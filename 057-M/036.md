# SwapHandler.sol: swapForTau function should not use hard-coded `Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE`

## Summary
The `SwapHandler` contract is a contract that all different types of Vaults will inherit since it is inherited from by `BaseVault`.

The Taurus protocol is supposed to support multiple collateral token in the future. GLP is only the beginning.
So the code in `SwapHandler` cannot be specific to GLP since other Vaults will use it as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `SwapHandler.swapForTau` function calculates the amount of protocol fees like so:

The formula makes use of `Constants.GLP_VAULT_PROTOCOL_FEE` which is the fee percentage that is specific for the GLP Vault.

## Impact
All Vaults will use the protocol fees for the GLP Vault which is wrong.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a Vault contract is initialized it should be possible to specify the hash which is used to identify the correct protocol fee percentage in the `feeMapping`.
