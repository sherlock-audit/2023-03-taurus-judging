# User is not allowed to hold a position at MIN_COLL_RATIO

## Summary
While it is evident from the docs and functionality that MIN_COLL_RATIO is the minimum collateral ratio that a user is allowed to hold a position at, the getAccountHealth function prevents user from this.

## Vulnerability Detail
The calcLiquidationDiscount() function correctly checks that the user's collateral ratio should be >= MIN_COLL_RATIO otherwise he can be liquidated. But the places where getAccountHealth() function is used returns faulty results when user's CR is actually = 1.2e18 ie. MIN_COLL_RATIO. This is due to wrong check at Line 126.

## Impact

Suppose that a user calls modifyPosition(). User's final collateral ratio after adding debt goes to 1.2e18 ( = MIN_COLL_RATIO). Now since mustCheckHealth = true, at Line 325 it calls getAccountHealth to check user position. This check causes revert for the user because of ratio > MIN_COLL_RATIO condition.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change Line 126 to ratio >= MIN_COLL_RATIO to allow positions to exist at the minimum collateral ratio.
