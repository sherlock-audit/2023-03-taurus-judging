# Liquidation should not increase collateralization ratio above what is necessary to take out a loan

## Summary
A loan can be taken out by providing enough collateral such that the collateralization ratio is `>120%`.

If the collateralization ratio drops below `120%`, the loan can be liquidated. And it can be liquidated by an amount such that the collateralization ratio ends up `<=130%`.

This can lead to two problems:
1. Users may easily get liquidated immediately after taking out a loan (i.e. within the same block). E.g. if a user takes out a loan with a collateralization ratio close to 120%, the price of the collateral may change enough within the same block to allow liquidation. There should be some buffer between the ratio at which users can take out a loan and at which they can get liquidated.
2. Liquidation should only increase the collateralization ratio until the loan is healthy again. A loan is healthy when the 120% collateralization ratio is reached. Liquidation should not be able to increase the collateralization ratio up to 130%. If you think about it, a liquidation that moves the liquidation ratio from 119% to 130% contains the increase from 129% to 130% which technically is the liquidation of a healthy loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user takes out a loan, the `getAccountHealth` function is called which checks that the collateralization ratio is bigger than `MIN_COL_RATIO=1.2e18` (120%):

When a liquidation occurs, the `_getMaxLiquidation` function calculates the maximum amount of debt that can get liquidated such that the collateralization ratio ends up `<=MAX_LIQ_COLL_RATIO=1.3e18` (130%):

It is not possible to liquidate more than this amount:

## Impact
Users can get instantly liquidated and the liquidation will liquidate a part of a healthy loan.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
My suggestion is to allow taking out a loan at a collateralzation ratio that is bigger than the collateralization ratio for liquidation.

E.g. allow taking out a loan at a collateralization ratio `>130%` and allow liquidation at a ratio `<120%`.

There is now a buffer between the ratio needed to take out a loan and the ratio at which liquidations can occur.

Also a loan can now get safely liquidated to a ratio of `130%` without liquidating a healthy loan (i.e. a loan with a collateralization ratio that is enough to take out a loan).
