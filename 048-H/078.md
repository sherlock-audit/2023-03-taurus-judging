# [High] `dripDuration` should be controlled by the caller rather than a fixed value

## Summary

Taurus prevents sandwich attacks by adding claimed fees to yields over time. The process for users to get yield is as follows:

1. User deposits collater to vault, the `cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral` is `TauPerColl0`
2. Keeper call contract `UniswapSwapAdapter`'s `swap` function to swap TAU with GLP
3. The TAU obtained by the swap will continue to be included in the reward TAU for 1 day
4. The `cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral` is `TauPerColl1` after 1 day
5. The user's yield is `(TauPerColl1 - TauPerColl0) * Collater `

The above process can run normally when Keeper calls `swap` every day. But if the keeper calls `swap` for more than 1 day, for example, 2 days, then the attacker can share the rewards of 2 days of staking by everyone with only 1 day of staking.

An attacker can cause a swap tooMuchSlippage error or insufficient TAU in the market by purchasing a large amount of TAU.

In addition, if the `dripDuration` is fixed at 1 day, the yields for users whose staking time is within one day will be reduced.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

User's yields will be reduced or shared equally by the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the `dripDuration` value is passed in by the keeper and is the actual yield time of the swap token.
