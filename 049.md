# SwapAdapterRegistry does not set DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

## Summary

The SwapAdapterRegistry inherits from OZ's AccessControl which sets the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to `0x00` per default. This role is able to grand any role and set any role admin.

The SwapAdapterRegistry uses modifier `onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)` to register or edit swap adapters, but no one has this role in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

If SwapAdapterRegistry is used with `SwapHandler`, no swap handler will be able to be registered and the `swapForTau()` function will always revert.

## Impact

No swap of yield reward for TAU will be possible, yield will be locked forever in vault.

## Code Snippet

SwapAdapterRegistry uses `onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)`:

`swapForTau()` will always revert:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the contract abstract so that it cannot be deployed or set the default admin role in a constructor like in `Controller.sol`
