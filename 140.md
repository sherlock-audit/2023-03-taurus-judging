# Liquidation bot can fail due to excessive gas consumption

## Summary

Liquidation bot can fail due to excessive gas consumption

## Vulnerability Detail

When fetching unhealthy accounts, the function `LiquidationBot::fetchUnhealthyAccounts` loops over all the accounts:

```solidity
 function fetchUnhealthyAccounts(
        uint256 _startIndex,
        address _vaultAddress
    ) external view returns (address[] memory unhealthyAccounts) {
        BaseVault vault = BaseVault(_vaultAddress);
        address[] memory accounts = vault.getUsers(_startIndex, _startIndex + offset);
        uint256 j;

        for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; ++i) {
            if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) j++;
        }

        unhealthyAccounts = new address[](j);
        j = 0;

        for (uint256 i; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            if (!vault.getAccountHealth(accounts[i])) unhealthyAccounts[j++] = accounts[i];
        }

        return unhealthyAccounts;
    }
```

The number of accounts can be a very high number which would lead to failure due to excessive gas consumption with the loops.

## Impact

Operation of the liquidation bot would fail due to excessive gas consumption.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

An upper bound on the number of accounts that are looped over can be implemented.
