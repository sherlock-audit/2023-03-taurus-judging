# Small reward amounts can round down to zero and not account towards loan self-repayment

## Summary
Small reward amounts can round down to zero and not account towards loan self-repayment

## Vulnerability Detail
TAU earned is calculated and accounted towards an account each time `updateReward` modifier is called.
```solidity
            uint256 _rewardDiff = cumulativeTauRewardPerCollateral -
                userDetails[_account].lastUpdatedRewardPerCollateral;

            // Calculate user's TAU earned since the last update, use it to pay off debt
            uint256 _tauEarned = (_rewardDiff * _userCollateral) / Constants.PRECISION;
```

`_rewardDiff` in the smallest possible timeframe is calculated in `TauDripFeed` as  
```solidity
uint256 _extraRewardPerCollateral = (_tokensToDisburse * Constants.PRECISION) / _currentCollateral;
```

To simplify: *Tau Earned = Yield in TAU  * User Collateral / Total Collateral.*

If yield and user collateral are low, the calculation may round down to 0. As a result, generated yield will not account for reducing user's debt. This can only become an issue if `updateReward` is called frequently to make sure that `_rewardDiff` is small enough. This is possible as there is an external function to update rewards for any account

An adversary can call this function frequently for some account in order to prevent it from reducing the debt.

## Impact
Earned yield will not account towards account's debt

## Recommendation

Restricting ` function updateRewards(address _account)` to only be used by a Keeper should be enough to mitigate this issue
