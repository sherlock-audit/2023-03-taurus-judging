# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with tether(USDT)

## Summary
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail
These calls to `approve()` should correctly set the approval to zero after the transfer is done, so that the next approval can go through.

## Impact
The code as currently implemented does not handle these sorts of tokens properly when they’re a Uniswap pool asset, which would prevent USDT, the sixth largest pool, from being used by this project. This project relies heavily on Uniswap, so this would hamper future growth and availability of the protocol.

## Code Snippet

1.  File: [/contracts/LiquidationBot/LiquidationBot.sol#L59-L61](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/LiquidationBot/LiquidationBot.sol#L59-L61)

```solidity
function approveTokens(address _tokenIn, address _vault) external onlyMultisig {
        IERC20(_tokenIn).approve(address(_vault), type(uint256).max);
    }
```

2.  File: [/contracts/SwapAdapters/UniswapSwapAdapter.sol#L53-L55](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-taurus/blob/main/taurus-contracts/contracts/SwapAdapters/UniswapSwapAdapter.sol#L53-L55)

```solidity
function approveTokens(address _tokenIn) external {
        IERC20(_tokenIn).approve(swapRouter, type(uint256).max);
    }
```

These calls to `approve()` should correctly set the approval to zero after the transfer is done, so that the next approval can go through.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`’s `safeTransfer()` instead.
