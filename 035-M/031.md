# SwapHandler.sol: Check that collateral token cannot be swapped is insufficient for tokens with multiple addresses

## Summary
According to the contest page `any non-rebasing` ERC20 token is supposed to be supported.

The `SwapHandler.swapForTau` function checks that the `collateralToken` cannot be sent to the `SwapAdapter` for trading:

## Vulnerability Detail
There exist however ERC20 tokens that have more than one address. In case of such a token, the above check is not sufficient. The token could be swapped anyway by using a different address.

## Impact
The check that collateral cannot be swapped can be bypassed for tokens with multiple addresses.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compare the balance of the collateral before and after sending tokens to the SwapAdapter and make sure it hasn't changed. Or implement a whitelist for tokens that can be swapped.
